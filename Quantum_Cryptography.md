# I. Foundations of Quantum Mechanics

## Understanding Quantum Principles

### Superposition and Qubits
*   Concept of superposition: a quantum bit (qubit) can exist in multiple states simultaneously.
*   Mathematical representation of a qubit: `α|0⟩ + β|1⟩`, where `|α|^2 + |β|^2 = 1`.
*   Bloch sphere representation of a qubit's state.

### Quantum Entanglement
*   Definition and properties of quantum entanglement: correlated quantum states between two or more qubits.
*   Bell states: `|Φ+⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2`, `|Φ-⟩ = (|00⟩ - |11⟩)/√2`, `|Ψ+⟩ = (|01⟩ + |10⟩)/√2`, `|Ψ-⟩ = (|01⟩ - |10⟩)/√2`.
*   EPR paradox and its implications.

### Quantum Measurement
*   Wave function collapse during measurement.
*   Born rule: probability of measuring a particular state.
*   Measurement in different bases.

## Key Concepts from Information Theory

### Classical Information Theory
*   Shannon's entropy: `H(X) = - Σ p(x) log₂ p(x)`.
*   Mutual information.

### Quantum Information Theory
*   Von Neumann entropy: `S(ρ) = -Tr(ρ log ρ)`.
*   Quantum mutual information.

# II. Principles of Quantum Cryptography

## Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

### BB84 Protocol
*   Protocol overview: Alice sends qubits encoded in one of four polarization states.
*   Basis reconciliation: Alice and Bob publicly compare bases to identify shared keys.
*   Eavesdropping detection: analyzing error rates (Quantum Bit Error Rate - QBER) to detect potential eavesdroppers (Eve).
*   Example: Alice sends qubits with polarization states 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°. Bob measures in rectilinear (0°, 90°) or diagonal (45°, 135°) bases.
*   Code example (Conceptual):
    ```python
    # Conceptual code - Simplified BB84 simulation
    alice_bits = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
    alice_bases = ['rectilinear', 'diagonal', 'rectilinear', 'diagonal', 'rectilinear']
    # ... (rest of the protocol simulation)
    ```

### E91 Protocol
*   Entanglement-based QKD.
*   Bell state preparation and distribution.
*   Eavesdropping detection using Bell's theorem violation.

### B92 Protocol
*   Simplified QKD using only two non-orthogonal states.
*   Reduced security compared to BB84.

## Security Analysis of QKD Protocols

### Eavesdropping Strategies
*   Intercept-resend attack.
*   Cloning attacks (No-Cloning theorem).
*   Man-in-the-middle attack.
*   Photon number splitting (PNS) attack.

### Security Proofs

*   Finite-key effects.
*   Composable security.
