# I. Introduction to Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)

## Understanding WAF Fundamentals

### Defining Web Application Firewalls
*   Explain the core functionality of a WAF.
*   Contrast WAFs with traditional firewalls and Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS).

### WAF Operating Principles
*   Describe how a WAF analyzes HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
*   Explain the concepts of positive and negative security models.
*   Discuss signature-based vs. anomaly-based detection.

### WAF Deployment Architectures
*   Cloud-based WAFs.
*   On-premise WAFs (hardware and software).
*   Hybrid WAF deployments.

# II. WAF Core Components and Functionality

## HTTP/HTTPS Traffic Analysis

### Understanding HTTP Request Structure
*   Analyze HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
*   Examine HTTP headers and their importance in security.
*   Learn how to decode URL encoding.

### Examining HTTP Response Structure
*   Understand HTTP status codes and their implications.
*   Analyze HTTP response headers.

### Common Web Application Attacks
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): understanding reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS.
    *   Example: Reflected XSS payload `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`.
*   SQL Injection (SQLi): understanding different types of SQLi.
    *   Example: SQLi payload `'; DROP TABLE users; --`.
*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): understanding CSRF attack vectors.
*   Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI).
    *   Example: LFI payload `../../../../etc/passwd`.
*   Command Injection.
    *   Example: Command injection payload `; ls -al`.
*   OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities: Understanding the current OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

## WAF Rule Sets and Policies

### Defining WAF Rules
*   Structure of a WAF rule (condition, action).
*   Understanding regular expressions for pattern matching.
    *   Example: Regular expression to detect SQLi `/(SELECT|UNION).*(FROM|WHERE)/i`.

### Implementing Rule Sets
*   Utilizing pre-defined rule sets (e.g., OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set).
*   Creating custom rules for specific application needs.

### WAF Policy Management
*   Prioritizing and managing WAF rules.
*   Testing and validating rule effectiveness.

# III. WAF Implementation and Configuration

## Selecting a WAF Solution

### Evaluating WAF Features
*   Performance considerations (latency, throughput).
*   Scalability and redundancy.
*   Reporting and logging capabilities.
*   Integration with other security tools (SIEM, vulnerability scanners).

### Choosing Deployment Model
*   Cloud-based vs. on-premise.
*   Managed vs. unmanaged WAF solutions.

## Configuring WAF Settings

### Initial Configuration
*   Defining protected resources (URLs, domains).
*   Setting up logging and reporting.

### Tuning WAF Rules
*   Adjusting sensitivity levels for different rules.
*   Creating exceptions for legitimate traffic.
*   Understanding false positives and false negatives.

### Monitoring and Maintenance
*   Analyzing WAF logs and reports.
*   Updating rule sets to address new threats.
*   Performing regular security audits.

# IV. Advanced WAF Concepts

## Bot Detection and Mitigation

### Understanding Bot Traffic
*   Identifying malicious bots (scrapers, spammers, vulnerability scanners).
*   Analyzing bot behavior patterns.

### Implementing Bot Mitigation Techniques
*   CAPTCHA challenges.
*   Rate limiting.
*   Behavioral analysis.
*   IP reputation analysis.

## API Security

### Protecting APIs with WAFs
*   Understanding API security threats (injection attacks, authentication bypass).
*   Configuring WAF rules to protect API endpoints.

### API-Specific Security Measures
*   Validating API input parameters.
*   Implementing rate limiting for API requests.
*   Protecting against API abuse.

## WAF Evasion Techniques and Countermeasures

### Common Evasion Techniques
*   Obfuscation of malicious payloads.
*   Using encoding to bypass WAF rules.
*   Fragmenting requests to avoid detection.

### Countermeasures
*   Advanced pattern matching.
*   Decoding and normalizing input data.
*   Reassembling fragmented requests.

# V. WAF Practical Applications and Tools

## WAF Deployment Scenarios

### Protecting Web Applications
*   Securing e-commerce websites.
*   Protecting content management systems (CMS).
*   Defending web APIs.

### Securing Cloud Environments
*   Utilizing cloud-based WAF services (e.g., AWS WAF, Azure WAF, Google Cloud Armor).
*   Integrating WAFs with cloud infrastructure.

## Hands-on Exercises

### Configuring a WAF (Example using ModSecurity)
*   Installing and configuring ModSecurity.
*   Writing basic ModSecurity rules.
    ```
    SecRule REQUEST_URI "@contains 'evilcode'" "id:12345,deny,status:403,msg:'Detected evil code'"
    ```
*   Testing WAF rules using common attack vectors.

### Analyzing WAF Logs
*   Using tools to parse and analyze WAF logs (e.g., `grep`, `awk`, `Splunk`).
*   Identifying and responding to security incidents.

### Simulating Attacks and Testing WAF Effectiveness
*   Using penetration testing tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to simulate attacks.
*   Evaluating the WAF's ability to detect and block attacks.
