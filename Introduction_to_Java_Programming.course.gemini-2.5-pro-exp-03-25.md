*   "<prompt>Generate a simple Java code example demonstrating thread creation by extending the `Thread` class."

### Basic Synchronization (Conceptual Introduction)
"<prompt>Briefly introduce the problem of race conditions when multiple threads access shared resources. Conceptually explain the need for synchronization using the `synchronized` keyword on methods or blocks, without delving into complex locking mechanisms."

## Introduction to Build Tools (`Maven`, `Gradle`)
"<prompt>Explain the role of build automation tools like Maven and Gradle in managing project dependencies, compiling code, running tests, and packaging applications (e.g., JAR files). Contrast this with manual compilation using `javac`."

### Dependency Management
"<prompt>Explain how build tools simplify managing external libraries (dependencies) by declaring them in a configuration file (e.g., `pom.xml` for Maven, `build.gradle` for Gradle) instead of manually downloading JAR files."

### Basic Project Structure
"<prompt>Briefly describe the standard directory layout typically used by Maven/Gradle projects (e.g., `src/main/java`, `src/test/java`)."

## Introduction to Debugging Techniques
"<prompt>Introduce the concept of debugging as the process of finding and fixing errors in code. Explain the importance of using an IDE's debugger."

### Using an IDE Debugger
"<prompt>Describe basic debugger features found in most IDEs: setting breakpoints, stepping through code (step over, step into, step out), inspecting variable values, and examining the call stack."
*   "<prompt>Suggest setting a breakpoint in a simple loop or conditional statement within the IDE and using step commands to observe program execution flow and variable changes."

## Performance Considerations (Brief Mention)
"<prompt>Briefly mention that choices like data structures (e.g., `ArrayList` vs. `LinkedList`), algorithms, and inefficient operations (like string concatenation in loops) can impact application performance. Introduce the idea of profiling as a way to measure performance (advanced topic for later study)."

## Section Summary
"<prompt>Provide a concise summary (2-3 sentences) introducing the advanced topics covered: Generics for type safety, basic multithreading concepts (`Thread`, `Runnable`), the role of build tools (Maven/Gradle), and fundamental debugging techniques using an IDE."

## Key Terms Glossary

## Self-Assessment Quiz
"<prompt>Generate 5 multiple-choice questions covering the introductory advanced topics: the primary benefit of Generics, the two main ways to create threads, the purpose of build tools, and basic IDE debugger actions (breakpoints, stepping). Include answers and explanations."

## Reflective Prompt
"<prompt>Generate a reflective question asking the learner to think about why using a build tool like Maven or Gradle becomes essential as Java projects grow in complexity and dependencies."

## Further Exploration
*   "<prompt>Provide a link to the Oracle Java tutorial section on Generics."
*   "<prompt>Provide a link to the Oracle Java tutorial section on Concurrency."
*   "<prompt>Provide links to the official websites for Apache Maven and Gradle."
*   "<prompt>Suggest searching for IDE-specific debugging tutorials (e.g., 'IntelliJ IDEA debugging tutorial', 'Eclipse debugging tutorial')."

## Course Conclusion Prompt
"<prompt>Write a brief concluding statement for the entire 'Introduction to Java Programming' agenda, summarizing the journey from fundamentals to introductory advanced topics and encouraging continued learning in specific areas like web development (Spring), Android development, or enterprise Java."
