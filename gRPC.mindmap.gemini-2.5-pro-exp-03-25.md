# gRPC #RPC #Framework
gRPC is a modern, high-performance, open-source Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework developed by Google. It enables efficient communication between services, especially in microservices architectures. #Overview #Introduction

## Core Concepts & Architecture #Basics #Theory
Fundamental ideas behind gRPC and how it is structured.
### Remote Procedure Call (RPC) #RPC #Concept
The idea of making a procedure/function call on a remote server as if it were local. gRPC is a modern implementation of this concept. #Definition
### Service Definition #Protobuf #IDL
Services and their methods (including parameters and return types) are defined in a language-agnostic way, typically using Protocol Buffers. #Contract
### Client-Server Model #Architecture #Pattern
gRPC follows a client-server architecture where clients invoke methods implemented on a remote server. #DistributedSystems
#### Client (Stub) #Client #Component
A client-side object (stub) provides the same methods as the remote service, handling the details of sending requests and receiving responses. #Stub
#### Server #Server #Component
The server implements the service interface defined in the `.proto` file and handles incoming client calls. #Implementation
### HTTP/2 #Transport #Protocol
gRPC utilizes HTTP/2 as its transport protocol, leveraging features like multiplexing, header compression, and streaming for efficiency. #HTTP2 #Performance
### Channels #Networking #Connection
A channel represents a logical connection to a gRPC server endpoint (host and port), used by the client stub to make calls. Channels manage underlying HTTP/2 connections. #Connectivity
### Metadata #Data #Context
Key-value pairs that can be sent with RPC calls, often used for authentication, tracing, or passing contextual information. #Headers
### Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Operations #ProgrammingModel #Concurrency
gRPC supports both blocking (synchronous) calls where the client waits for the response, and non-blocking (asynchronous) calls where the response is handled later, often via callbacks or futures. #Async #Sync

## Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) #Protobuf #Serialization
The default Interface Definition Language (IDL) and serialization format for gRPC.
### Schema Definition (`.proto` files) #IDL #Contract
Text files where services, methods, and message structures are defined using Protobuf syntax (proto3 is the current recommended version). #ProtoFile
### Message Structure #DataModel #Structure
Defining data structures (messages) with typed fields. Fields are identified by numbers for efficient binary serialization. #Messages #Fields
### Data Types #Typing #Schema
Protobuf supports various scalar types (int32, string, bool, bytes, etc.), enumerations, nested messages, and composite types like maps and oneofs. #Types
### Service Definitions #API #RPC
Defining services with methods (RPCs) that specify request and response message types (including streaming). #Services #Methods
### `protoc` Compiler #Tooling #CodeGeneration
The Protocol Buffers compiler (`protoc`) takes `.proto` files and generates language-specific code (stubs, message classes, server interfaces) for client and server implementation. #Compiler
### Binary Serialization #Encoding #Efficiency
Protobuf encodes messages into a compact binary format, which is faster to parse and smaller than text-based formats like JSON or XML. #BinaryFormat #Performance

## Communication Patterns #Streaming #APIStyle
gRPC supports various ways for clients and servers to communicate.
### Unary RPC #RequestResponse #Simple
The classic RPC model: client sends a single request, server sends back a single response. #Unary
`rpc MethodName(RequestType) returns (ResponseType);`
### Server Streaming RPC #ServerStream #OneToMany
Client sends a single request, server responds with a stream of messages. The client reads messages until the stream ends. #Streaming
`rpc MethodName(RequestType) returns (stream ResponseType);`
### Client Streaming RPC #ClientStream #ManyToOne
Client sends a stream of messages, server waits for the client to finish and then sends back a single response. #Streaming
`rpc MethodName(stream RequestType) returns (ResponseType);`
### Bidirectional Streaming RPC #BiDiStream #ManyToMany
Both client and server send independent streams of messages over the same connection. The streams operate independently. #Streaming #Realtime
`rpc MethodName(stream RequestType) returns (stream ResponseType);`

## Key Features & Capabilities #Features #Advantages
Distinctive features that gRPC offers.
### Performance #Efficiency #Speed
High performance due to HTTP/2, binary serialization (Protobuf), and efficient connection management. Often significantly faster than REST+JSON. #Performance
### Code Generation #Development #Tooling
Automatic generation of client stubs and server skeletons in multiple languages from `.proto` files, simplifying development and ensuring type safety. #CodeGen #Productivity
### Strongly Typed Contracts #TypeSafety #Contract
Service interfaces and message structures are strictly defined in `.proto` files, reducing runtime errors and improving maintainability. #StaticTyping
### Streaming Support #Realtime #DataFlow
Native support for various streaming patterns (server, client, bidirectional), essential for real-time applications or large data transfers. #Streaming
### Deadlines/Timeouts #Reliability #Control
Clients can specify how long they are willing to wait for an RPC to complete, allowing servers to abort operations if needed. #Timeout
### Cancellation #Control #ResourceManagement
Clients can cancel RPCs that are no longer needed, helping save resources on the server. #Cancellation
### Pluggable Authentication #Security #AuthN
Supports various authentication mechanisms like SSL/TLS and token-based authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0). #Authentication
### Pluggable Load Balancing #Scalability #Distribution
Client-side load balancing strategies can be configured to distribute requests across multiple server instances. #LoadBalancing
### Service Discovery #Microservices #Networking
Mechanisms to allow clients to dynamically discover server endpoints. Often integrated with systems like Kubernetes or Consul. #Discovery
### Flow Control #Networking #ResourceManagement
Leverages HTTP/2 flow control to manage data transmission and prevent overwhelming receivers. #FlowControl
### Interceptors / Middleware #Extensibility #CrossCuttingConcerns
Allows injecting custom logic (e.g., logging, monitoring, authentication) into the request/response lifecycle on both client and server. #Middleware #Interceptors
### Health Checking #Reliability #Monitoring
Standardized protocol for servers to report their health status, often used by load balancers and orchestration systems. #HealthCheck
### Reflection #Discovery #Introspection
Allows servers to expose information about their available gRPC services at runtime without needing the original `.proto` files. #Reflection
