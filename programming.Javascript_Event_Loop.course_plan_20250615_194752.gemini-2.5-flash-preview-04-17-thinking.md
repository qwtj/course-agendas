"<prompt>Describe how unhandled rejections often manifest after the current microtask queue is processed, sometimes leading to global error events, prepare for level 3 headings.</platform>"

#### Handling
"<prompt>Provide methods for handling Promise rejections, including always chaining a `.catch()` method and using global unhandled rejection event handlers (`unhandledrejection` in browsers, `unhandledRejection` in Node.js), prepare for level 3 headings.</platform>"

## Callback Hell / Pyramid of Doom
"<prompt>Describe the code readability and maintainability issue known as 'Callback Hell' or the 'Pyramid of Doom' that results from deeply nested asynchronous callbacks, prepare for level 3 headings.</platform>"

#### Solutions (Promises, Async/Await)
"<prompt>Explain how modern asynchronous patterns like Promises (with `.then` chaining) and especially `async`/`await` syntax provide cleaner, flatter code structures that solve the issues of Callback Hell, prepare for level 3 headings.</platform>"

## Race Conditions
"<prompt>Introduce the concept of Race Conditions in asynchronous JavaScript, where the final state depends on the non-deterministic completion order of multiple asynchronous tasks, prepare for level 3 headings.</platform>"

#### Definition in Async JS
"<prompt>Define a race condition in the context of the Event Loop scheduling asynchronous callbacks, where the outcome is unpredictable because two or more callbacks might finish and execute in an order that wasn't intended or guaranteed, prepare for level 3 headings.</platform>"

#### Mitigation Strategies
"<prompt>Suggest strategies for mitigating race conditions, such as using `Promise.all`, `Promise.race`, or libraries like `async` to control the flow and synchronization of asynchronous operations, or careful state management, prepare for level 3 headings.</platform>"

## Interactive Debugging Practice
"<prompt>Create prompts for hands-on debugging exercises where learners are given code snippets with common Event Loop-related issues (e.g., a blocking loop, a race condition, unhandled rejection) and guided on using developer tools to diagnose and fix them, prepare for level 2 headings.</platform>"

## Section Summary
"<prompt>Provide a concise summary of common Event Loop-related issues (blocking, infinite loops, unhandled rejections, callback hell, race conditions) and the essential tools and techniques for diagnosing and resolving them, emphasizing the use of browser and Node.js profiling tools, prepare for level 2 headings.</platform>"

# VIII. Evolution of the Event Loop & Async JS

## Clarify Learning Objectives for this Section
"<prompt>Define the learning objectives for understanding the historical evolution of asynchronous programming patterns in JavaScript and how the Event Loop mechanism and its interaction with language features have evolved over time, prepare for level 2 headings.</platform>"

## From Callbacks to Promises
"<prompt>Describe the historical shift in preferred asynchronous patterns in JavaScript, detailing the transition from primarily using simple callbacks to adopting Promises as a more structured way to manage async operations, prepare for level 2 headings.</platform>"

## The rise of Async/Await
"<prompt>Explain the impact of the introduction of `async`/`await` syntax, highlighting how it built upon Promises to make asynchronous code significantly more readable and easier to reason about, preparing for level 2 headings.</platform>"

## Changes in Microtask/Macrotask handling over time
"<prompt>Briefly discuss how the formal specification and practical implementation details regarding the precise timing and interaction between macrotasks and microtasks have evolved and been clarified over time in standards and browser/Node.js updates, prepare for level 2 headings.</platform>"

## Node.js Event Loop Evolution
"<prompt>Mention that the Node.js Event Loop, based on libuv, has also seen internal refinements and updates across versions, sometimes subtly affecting the behavior of functions like `process.nextTick` and `setImmediate`, prepare for level 2 headings.</platform>"

## Reflective Prompt
"<prompt>Pose a reflective question asking the learner to consider how the evolution from callbacks to async/await simplifies writing complex asynchronous logic and helps avoid common pitfalls like callback hell, prepare for level 2 headings.</platform>"

## Section Summary
"<prompt>Provide a concise summary outlining the key evolutionary steps in JavaScript's asynchronous landscape, from callbacks to Promises and async/await, and noting that the Event Loop implementations in browsers and Node.js have also undergone refinements, prepare for level 2 headings.</platform>"
