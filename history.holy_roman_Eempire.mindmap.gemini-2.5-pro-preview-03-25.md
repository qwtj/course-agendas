# Holy Roman Empire #HRE #History #Europe
The Holy Roman Empire was a complex political entity in Western and Central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars. It was envisioned as a successor to the Roman Empire in the West, with its emperors claiming universal authority over Christendom, though its power was often decentralized and contested.

## Origins and Formation #EarlyMiddleAges #Foundation
The roots and formal establishment of the Empire.

### Carolingian Precursors #Charlemagne #Franks
The empire traced its ideological beginnings to Charlemagne, King of the Franks.

#### Coronation of Charlemagne (800 AD) #PopeLeoIII #RomanEmperor
Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as 'Emperor of the Romans' on Christmas Day 800, reviving the imperial title in the West. This event symbolized a shift in papal allegiance from the Byzantine Empire towards the Frankish power.

#### Treaty of Verdun (843 AD) #CarolingianEmpire #Division
Following Charlemagne's death, internal conflicts led to the division of the Carolingian Empire among his grandsons (Lothair I, Louis the German, Charles the Bald), weakening central authority. East Francia would form the core of the later HRE.

### Ottonian Revival (10th Century) #Ottonians #Germany
Consolidation of power in East Francia and the formal establishment of the HRE.

#### Otto I (The Great) #SaxonDynasty #KingOfGermany
Otto I became King of Germany (East Francia) in 936, unifying German tribes and expanding his power. He defeated the Magyars at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955.

#### Imperial Coronation of Otto I (962 AD) #PopeJohnXII #FoundationDate
Otto I aided Pope John XII against his enemies in Italy and was crowned Emperor in Rome in 962. This event is traditionally considered the formal beginning of the Holy Roman Empire, establishing a continuous line of emperors linked to the German kingship.

## Political Structure and Governance #Politics #Government #Decentralization
The complex and often decentralized system of rule within the Empire.

### Emperor (Kaiser) #Monarchy #HeadOfState
The elected monarch and titular head of the Empire.

#### Role and Powers #ImperialAuthority #LimitedPower
Theoretically the supreme secular ruler of Western Christendom and successor to the Roman Emperors. Powers included conferring titles, final legal judgment, and calling imperial diets. However, imperial power was often limited by the princes and electors.

#### Election #ElectiveMonarchy #PrinceElectors
The Emperor was chosen by a specific group of powerful territorial rulers known as Prince-Electors (Kurfürsten). Initially informal, the process was formalized by the Golden Bull of 1356.

#### Coronation #PapalCoronation #ImperialRegalia
Traditionally, the King of Germany/King of the Romans needed to be crowned by the Pope in Rome to gain the full title of Emperor. Later coronations occurred elsewhere (e.g., Frankfurt). Important symbols included the Imperial Crown, Sceptre, and Orb.

### Imperial Diet (Reichstag) #Legislature #Assembly
The primary legislative and consultative assembly of the Empire, theoretically superior to the Emperor.

#### Composition #Estates #Colleges
Comprised three colleges:
1.  Council of Electors: The seven (later more) Prince-Electors.
2.  Council of Princes: Other secular and ecclesiastical princes (dukes, margraves, bishops, abbots, etc.). Divided into benches with individual or collective votes (curiae).
3.  Council of Imperial Cities: Representatives of the Free Imperial Cities.

#### Imperial Courts #Justice #Law
*   Reichshofrat (Aulic Council): Court based in Vienna, directly advising the Emperor.
*   Reichskammergericht (Imperial Chamber Court): Established by Imperial Reform, based elsewhere (e.g., Wetzlar), intended to provide justice independent of the Emperor's direct influence.

#### Imperial Reform (Reichsreform) #LateMiddleAges #Modernization
A series of legislative efforts in the late 15th and early 16th centuries (e.g., Diet of Worms 1495) aimed at creating more unified structures, including the Imperial Circles, courts, and attempts at common taxation and administration.

### Territorial Entities #Feudalism #States

#### Prince-Electors #Kurfürsten #Election

#### Princely States #Duchies #Counties #Bishoprics
Territories ruled by dukes, counts, princes, bishops, abbots, etc., holding varying degrees of autonomy (known as *Landeshoheit*).
