# I. Introduction to NX Mono Application Framework

## Understanding the NX Philosophy and Architecture

### Principles of Monorepo Development

### Core Concepts: Nx Workspaces, Projects, and Tasks

### Benefits of Using NX: Consistency, Scalability, and Maintainability

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Installing Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm)

### Installing the NX CLI Globally: `npm install -g create-nx-workspace`

### Creating a New NX Workspace: `create-nx-workspace my-org`

### Choosing a Preset (e.g., react, angular, nextjs, node)

# II. Working with NX Workspaces

## Workspace Structure and Configuration

### Understanding the `nx.json` File

### Analyzing the `workspace.json` (or `angular.json` for Angular)

### Exploring the `tsconfig.base.json` and Path Aliases

## Creating and Managing Projects

### Generating Applications: `nx g @nx/react:app my-react-app`

### Generating Libraries: `nx g @nx/js:lib my-js-lib`

### Project Configuration: `.eslintrc.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and Build/Test Targets

## Task Running and Caching

### Running Targets: `nx build my-react-app`, `nx test my-js-lib`

### Understanding Task Hashing and Caching

### Configuring Task Pipelines: `nx.json` `targetDefaults` and `namedInputs`

### Remote Caching: NX Cloud

# III. Dependency Management and Code Sharing

## Understanding Dependency Graphs

### Visualizing the Dependency Graph: `nx graph`

### Analyzing Import Boundaries

### Defining and Enforcing Module Boundaries: `nx g @nx/enforce-module-boundaries`

## Code Sharing Strategies

### Creating and Using Shared Libraries

### Exporting and Importing Modules within the Workspace

### Refactoring Code into Reusable Libraries

## Versioning and Publishing Libraries

### Utilizing Semantic Versioning

### Publishing Libraries to npm (or a Private Registry)

# IV. Testing and Linting

## Setting Up Testing Frameworks

### Configuring Jest for React Applications

### Configuring Jest for Node.js Libraries

### Configuring Cypress for End-to-End Testing

## Writing Unit Tests and Integration Tests

### Implementing Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### Writing Mocking and Stubbing Functions

### Measuring Code Coverage

## Code Linting and Formatting

### Configuring ESLint for Code Style and Best Practices

### Setting Up Prettier for Code Formatting

### Integrating ESLint and Prettier with VS Code (or Other Editors)

### Running Linting and Formatting Checks: `nx lint my-react-app`, `nx format:check`

# V. Building and Deploying

## Building Applications and Libraries

### Understanding Build Artifacts

### Configuring Build Targets

### Optimizing Builds for Production

## Deployment Strategies

### Deploying to Static Hosting Providers (e.g., Netlify, Vercel)

### Deploying to Cloud Platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

### Containerizing Applications with Docker

## CI/CD Integration

### Setting Up CI/CD Pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI)

### Automating Builds, Tests, and Deployments

### Implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery

# VI. Advanced NX Concepts

## Custom Generators

### Creating Custom Generators for Code Scaffolding

### Using Schematics to Modify Files

### Automating Repetitive Tasks with Generators

## Custom Executors

### Building Custom Executors for Specific Build or Task Requirements

### Integrating with Existing Tools or Frameworks

### Extending NX's Functionality with Executors

## NX Plugins

### Creating NX Plugins to Share Custom Generators and Executors

### Publishing NX Plugins to npm

### Contributing to the NX Ecosystem

## Working with Monorepo Tooling Beyond NX (Optional)

### Comparing NX with Lerna, Turborepo, Rush
