# LangGraph #Overview #Framework
LangGraph is an open-source library built upon LangChain, designed for creating stateful, multi-actor applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a more controllable, low-level framework for orchestrating complex agentic workflows compared to standard LangChain agents, modeling interactions as graphs. #LangChain #Agents #Orchestration

## Core Concepts #Fundamentals #Basics
Fundamental ideas and terminology used within LangGraph. #Terminology #BuildingBlocks

### Graph Structure #Architecture #Design
Represents the workflow as a directed graph. #GraphTheory #WorkflowDesign [6, 8]
Nodes and edges define the flow of computation and decision-making. [2, 4, 5, 8, 19, 21]

### State #StateManagement #Memory
A central, shared data structure holding the current snapshot of the application's information. [4, 5, 6, 21, 23]
Can be a dictionary, Pydantic model, or dataclass. [21, 24]
Persists across nodes and edges, enabling context and memory. [5, 21]

### Nodes #Computation #Actions
Represent units of computation or actions within the graph. [2, 4, 8, 21]
Typically implemented as Python functions or other callables. [4, 8, 21]
Receive the current state, perform operations, and return updates to the state. [21, 24]

### Edges #ControlFlow #Routing
Define the transitions and connections between nodes. [2, 4, 8, 21]
Determine the next node(s) to execute based on the current state. [2, 21]
Can be simple (direct transitions) or conditional (branching logic). [2, 8, 21]

### Cycles #Loops #Iteration
A key feature allowing workflows to loop back to previous nodes. [2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 18]
Essential for building agent runtimes that require iteration, reflection, or retries. [2, 4, 5]
Distinguishes LangGraph from purely Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) frameworks like standard LangChain chains. [4, 8]

## Graph Architecture & Structure #DesignPatterns #Blueprints
How graphs are constructed and organized in LangGraph. #Structure #Layout

### StateGraph #GraphClass #Implementation
The primary class for defining a stateful graph. [2, 4, 11, 24]
Requires defining the state schema (e.g., using TypedDict or Pydantic). [4, 21, 24]

### Defining Nodes #NodeCreation #Functions
Adding computational steps (functions/callables) to the graph. [2, 4, 11, 24]
Nodes operate on and return updates to the defined state schema. [21, 24]

### Defining Edges #EdgeCreation #Connections
Connecting nodes to define the sequence of execution. [2, 4, 11, 24]
Specifying entry points (`START`) and end points (`END`). [4, 8]

#### Normal Edges #DirectFlow #Sequential
Unconditional transitions from one node to the next. [8, 21]

#### Conditional Edges #Branching #DecisionMaking
Edges that route the flow based on the current state, enabling decision-making. [2, 8, 21]
Implemented as functions that return the name of the next node(s). [2, 21]

### Compiling the Graph #Execution #Runtime
Creating a runnable instance of the defined graph structure using the `compile()` method. [4, 8, 11]
Optionally accepts a checkpointer for persistence. [9, 12, 15]

## State Management #Memory #Context
Handling the application's state throughout the graph's execution. #Persistence #DataFlow [6, 23, 24]

### State Definition #Schema #DataModel
Defining the structure of the state using TypedDict, Pydantic models, or dataclasses. [21, 24]
Ensures type safety and clear data structure.

### State Updates #Modification #Mutation
Nodes return updates to the state rather than modifying it in place. [21, 24]
Updates are merged into the main state according to defined rules (reducers). [24, 25]

### Reducers #StateMerging #UpdateLogic
Functions that define how updates from nodes are merged into the overall state. [24, 25]
Allows fine-grained control over state updates (e.g., appending to lists, overwriting values). [25]

### Persistence & Checkpointing #SavingState #Resuming [4, 5, 9, 12, 14, 15, 21]
Saving the graph's state at various steps to enable memory, retries, and human-in-the-loop. #FaultTolerance #MemoryManagement
Checkpointers (`BaseCheckpointSaver`) handle saving/loading state snapshots. [9, 15, 21]
Supports various backends (in-memory, SQLite, Postgres). [9]
Allows resuming graph execution from a saved state using `thread_id`. [9, 12]
Enables features like "time travel" (rewinding state). [9, 11]
