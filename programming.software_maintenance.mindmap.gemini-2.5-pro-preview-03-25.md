# Software Maintenance #Lifecycle #Optimization

Software maintenance encompasses all activities undertaken after software delivery to correct faults, enhance performance or other attributes, or adapt the product to a modified environment. It's a crucial phase ensuring the software's longevity, reliability, and continued value. Estimates suggest maintenance accounts for 40-80% of the total cost of software ownership.
