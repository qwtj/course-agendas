# Database Access Caching Solutions #Caching #Performance #Scalability
Overview of techniques and technologies used to temporarily store database query results or data objects to reduce direct database load, decrease latency, and improve application performance.

## Fundamentals of Caching #Basics #Theory #Concepts
Core principles and motivations behind using caching for database access.

### What is Caching? #Definition #Purpose
Storing copies of data in a temporary, faster-access location (cache) to serve future requests more quickly.

### Why Cache Database Access? #Benefits #Motivation
    *   **Reduced Latency:** Faster data retrieval compared to direct database queries. #Latency
    *   **Improved Throughput:** Handling more requests per unit of time. #Throughput
    *   **Reduced Database Load:** Fewer queries hitting the primary database, saving resources and cost. #DatabaseLoad #CostSaving
    *   **Increased Application Scalability:** Allows applications to handle more users/load without scaling the database proportionally. #Scalability
    *   **Network Traffic Reduction:** Less data transfer between application and database tiers. #Network

### When *Not* to Cache #Drawbacks #Considerations
    *   Highly volatile data requiring real-time accuracy. #DataVolatility
    *   Write-heavy workloads where cache consistency is complex/costly. #WriteHeavy
    *   Situations where cache maintenance overhead outweighs benefits. #Overhead
    *   Infrequently accessed data (low cache hit ratio). #HitRatio

### Key Caching Metrics #Metrics #Measurement
    *   **Cache Hit Ratio:** Percentage of requests served successfully from the cache. #HitRatio
    *   **Cache Miss Rate:** Percentage of requests requiring database access. #MissRate
    *   **Cache Latency:** Time taken to retrieve data from the cache. #Latency
    *   **Eviction Rate:** Rate at which items are removed from the cache. #Eviction

## Caching Architectures and Tiers #Architecture #Layers #Placement
Where caching solutions can be implemented within an application stack.

### Client-Side Caching #ClientSide #Browser #Mobile
Caching directly within the user's browser or mobile application.
    *   HTTP Caching headers (ETag, Cache-Control). #HTTPCaching
    *   Local Storage / Session Storage. #WebStorage
    *   Mobile application local databases/stores. #MobileCaching

### Application-Level Caching (In-Process) #ApplicationLevel #InMemory
Caching data directly within the application's memory space.
    *   Typically library-based (e.g., Ehcache, Guava Cache, Caffeine). #Libraries
    *   Fastest access, but limited to a single application instance. #SingleInstance
    *   Cache size limited by application heap memory. #MemoryLimits
    *   Data lost on application restart. #Volatility

### External/Distributed Caching (Out-of-Process) #Distributed #RemoteCache #Middleware
Using a separate caching service shared by multiple application instances.
    *   Dedicated cache servers/clusters (e.g., Redis, Memcached). #Redis #Memcached
    *   Provides shared cache state across application nodes. #SharedState
    *   Scales independently of the application. #Scalability
    *   Adds network latency compared to in-process caching. #NetworkLatency
    *   Requires serialization/deserialization. #Serialization

### Content Delivery Network (CDN) Caching #CDN #EdgeCaching
Caching static assets and sometimes dynamic API responses closer to end-users globally.
    *   Primarily for geographically distributed users. #GeoDistribution
    *   Reduces latency by serving from edge locations. #EdgeComputing
    *   Offloads traffic from origin servers. #TrafficOffload

### Database-Level Caching #DatabaseCaching #Integrated
Caching mechanisms built into or closely integrated with the database system itself.
    *   Query Result Caching (often discouraged for general use due to invalidation complexity). #QueryCache
    *   Database Buffer Pool / Shared Pool (internal DB optimization, not application-controlled cache). #BufferPool
    *   Materialized Views (pre-computed query results stored as tables). #MaterializedViews

### Proxy Caching #Proxy #Gateway
Caching performed by an intermediate layer like an API Gateway or reverse proxy.
    *   Can cache responses for common requests. #APIGateway
    *   Transparent to application and client in some cases. #Transparency

## Caching Strategies and Patterns #Strategies #Patterns #DataFlow
Common approaches for populating and interacting with the cache.

### Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading) #CacheAside #LazyLoading
Application code manages cache interaction.
    *   Check cache first. #CheckCache
    *   If miss: Load data from DB. #LoadFromDB
    *   Populate cache with loaded data. #PopulateCache
    *   Return data.
    *   Pros: Resilient to cache failure, only requested data is cached.
    *   Cons: Cache miss penalty (latency spike), potential for stale data.

### Read-Through #ReadThrough #InlineCaching
Application treats cache as the primary data source; cache handles DB interaction on miss.
    *   Application requests data from cache. #RequestCache
    *   If miss: Cache loads data from DB itself. #CacheLoadsDB
    *   Cache populates itself and returns data to application. #PopulateAndReturn
    *   Pros: Simpler application code.
    *   Cons: Requires cache provider support, initial request latency on miss.

### Write-Through #WriteThrough #SynchronousWrite
Application writes data to cache first, and cache immediately writes to DB.
    *   Application updates cache. #UpdateCache
    *   Cache synchronously updates database. #UpdateDB
    *   Write operation completes after both succeed.
    *   Pros: High data consistency between cache and DB.
    *   Cons: Higher write latency (waits for both cache and DB).

### Write-Behind (Write-Back) #WriteBehind #AsynchronousWrite
Application writes data to cache; cache asynchronously writes to DB later.
    *   Application updates cache. #UpdateCache
    *   Write operation completes quickly (cache write).
    *   Cache queues data and writes to DB asynchronously in batches/intervals. #AsyncUpdateDB
    *   Pros: Low write latency, reduces DB write load.
    *   Cons: Risk of data loss if cache fails before DB write, eventual consistency.

### Write-Around #WriteAround #BypassCacheOnWrite
Writes go directly to the database, bypassing the cache. Cache is populated on subsequent reads (cache-aside).
    *   Application writes directly to DB. #WriteToDB
    *   Cache data might become stale immediately. #StaleData
    *   Cache populated only on read miss. #PopulateOnRead
    *   Pros: Simple write path.
    *   Cons: Read misses after writes until cache re-populates, potentially higher read latency initially.

### Cache Warming (Pre-heating) #CacheWarming #Preheating
Proactively loading data into the cache before it's requested.
    *   Often done at application startup or during low-traffic periods. #Startup #LowTraffic
    *   Reduces initial miss penalties for frequently accessed data. #ReduceMissPenalty
    *   Requires knowledge of expected data usage patterns. #UsagePatterns

## Cache Invalidation Techniques #Invalidation #Consistency #Staleness
Strategies to ensure cached data stays reasonably up-to-date with the source database.

### Time-To-Live (TTL) Expiration #TTL #Expiration
Setting a maximum lifespan for cached items.
    *   Simple to implement. #Simplicity
    *   Data can be stale for up to the TTL duration. #StaleDataRisk
    *   Good for data where slight staleness is acceptable. #AcceptableStaleness

### Time-To-Idle (TTI) Expiration #TTI #IdleExpiration
Evicting items that haven't been accessed for a specified duration.
    *   Keeps frequently used items longer. #FrequencyBased
    *   Less predictable expiration than TTL.

### Explicit Invalidation / Manual Purging #ManualInvalidation #Purge
Application code explicitly removes items from the cache when source data changes.
    *   Provides precise control. #Control
    *   Requires careful implementation to invalidate correctly. #Complexity
    *   Can be triggered by database updates. #UpdateTriggered

### Event-Based Invalidation #EventDriven #MessageQueue #CDC
Using events (e.g., from message queues, database triggers, Change Data Capture) to signal cache invalidation.
    *   Near real-time invalidation possible. #RealTime
    *   Decouples cache invalidation logic. #Decoupling
    *   Increases system complexity (requires event infrastructure). #SystemComplexity

### Write-Through Invalidation #WriteThroughInvalidation
Implicit invalidation as part of the write-through strategy (updates cache and DB).

### Lease-Based Mechanisms #Lease #DistributedLocking
Using distributed locks or leases to manage concurrent access and invalidation, especially in distributed systems.
