# I. Fundamentals of Music Theory

## Understanding Basic Music Notation

### Staff, Clef, and Ledger Lines
*   Treble Clef (G Clef)
*   Bass Clef (F Clef)
*   Alto Clef (C Clef)
*   Reading notes on the staff (e.g., `EGBDF`, `FACE` for treble clef lines and spaces)

### Note Values and Rhythm
*   Whole note, half note, quarter note, eighth note, sixteenth note, etc.
*   Rests corresponding to each note value
*   Time signatures (e.g., 4/4, 3/4, 6/8)
*   Understanding beat and tempo
*   Dotted notes and ties

## Understanding Intervals

### Identifying Intervals
*   Major, minor, perfect, augmented, and diminished intervals
*   Calculating intervals between notes (e.g., C to G is a perfect fifth)
*   Inverting intervals

### Consonant and Dissonant Intervals

### Compound Intervals

# II. Diatonic Harmony

## Understanding Scales and Keys

### Major Scales
*   Constructing major scales using the whole and half step pattern (W-W-H-W-W-W-H)
*   Key signatures of major keys (sharps and flats)
*   Circle of Fifths

### Minor Scales
*   Natural minor scale
*   Harmonic minor scale
*   Melodic minor scale (ascending and descending forms)
*   Key signatures of minor keys (relative minor)

### Understanding Key Signatures

## Chords: Construction and Function

### Triads
*   Major triads (Root, Major Third, Perfect Fifth)
*   Minor triads (Root, Minor Third, Perfect Fifth)
*   Augmented triads (Root, Major Third, Augmented Fifth)
*   Diminished triads (Root, Minor Third, Diminished Fifth)

### Seventh Chords
*   Major seventh chords (Major Triad + Major Seventh)
*   Dominant seventh chords (Major Triad + Minor Seventh)
*   Minor seventh chords (Minor Triad + Minor Seventh)
*   Half-diminished seventh chords (Diminished Triad + Minor Seventh)
*   Diminished seventh chords (Diminished Triad + Diminished Seventh)

### Chord Inversions
*   Root position, first inversion, second inversion (triads)
*   Voice leading considerations in inversions

## Diatonic Chord Progressions

### Roman Numeral Analysis
*   Representing chords with Roman numerals (I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, viiÂ°)
*   Identifying chord functions (tonic, dominant, subdominant)

### Common Chord Progressions
*   I-IV-V-I progression
*   ii-V-I progression
*   vi-IV-I-V progression

### Cadences
*   Authentic cadence (V-I)
*   Plagal cadence (IV-I)
*   Half cadence (ending on V)
*   Deceptive cadence (V-vi)

# III. Modes

## Understanding Modes of the Major Scale

### Ionian Mode (Major Scale)

### Dorian Mode
*   Formula: W-H-W-W-W-H-W-W or 2-1-2-2-2-1-2
*   Character: Minor sound with a raised 6th

### Phrygian Mode
*   Formula: H-W-W-W-H-W-W or 1-2-2-2-1-2-2
*   Character: Minor sound with a b2 (minor second)

### Lydian Mode
*   Formula: W-W-W-H-W-W-W-H or 2-2-2-1-2-2-2-1
*   Character: Major sound with a #4 (augmented fourth)

### Mixolydian Mode
*   Formula: W-W-H-W-W-H-W or 2-2-1-2-2-1-2
*   Character: Major sound with a b7 (minor seventh) - dominant

### Aeolian Mode (Natural Minor Scale)

### Locrian Mode
*   Formula: H-W-W-H-W-W-W or 1-2-2-1-2-2-2
*   Character: Diminished sound, unstable, tritone between root and 5th

## Modal Harmony

### Chord Progressions in Each Mode
*   Identifying chords that emphasize the characteristic notes of each mode.
*   Example: Dorian - i-IV-v-i

### Modal Interchange

# IV. Applying Diatonic Arpeggios and Modes

## Diatonic Arpeggios

### Constructing Diatonic Arpeggios
*   Major, minor, diminished, and augmented arpeggios within a given key.
*   Arpeggiating seventh chords (e.g., Maj7, m7, Dom7, m7b5)

### Practicing Arpeggio Patterns
*   Various fingerings and exercises for efficient execution.
*   Applying arpeggios over chord progressions.

### Using Arpeggios in Improvisation

## Modal Improvisation

### Identifying the Mode of a Melody

### Improvising Melodies Using Modes
*   Focusing on the characteristic intervals of each mode.
*   Creating melodies that reflect the specific mood or character of a mode.

### Creating Backing Tracks for Modal Improvisation
*   Using software (e.g., GarageBand, Ableton Live) to create chord progressions within a mode.
*   Looping chord progressions for practice.
