# Stream Processing #Overview #DataEngineering #RealTime
Stream processing involves continuously processing unbounded sequences of data (streams) as they arrive, typically with low latency.

## Introduction & Fundamentals #Basics #Concepts #CoreIdeas
Understanding the core ideas behind stream processing.

### What is Stream Processing? #Definition #Introduction
Processing data in motion, as opposed to batch processing of data at rest.

### Why Stream Processing? #Motivation #Benefits #Latency
Need for real-time insights, low-latency response, handling high-velocity data.

### Key Characteristics #Attributes #Properties
Velocity, Volume, Variety, Veracity (often related to Big Data), Unboundedness, Order.

### Stream vs. Batch Processing #Comparison #DataProcessingParadigm
Differences in data handling (bounded vs. unbounded), latency, processing triggers, state management.

### Event Time vs. Processing Time vs. Ingestion Time #TimeSemantics #Ordering #Accuracy
Critical concepts for handling out-of-order events and achieving correct results.
*   Event Time: The time an event actually occurred at the source.
*   Processing Time: The time the event is processed by the system.
*   Ingestion Time: The time the event arrives at the processing system.

## Core Concepts & Mechanisms #Fundamentals #ProcessingLogic #Techniques
Essential building blocks and techniques used in stream processing systems.

### Data Streams #DataModel #Events #Sequence
Understanding streams as unbounded sequences of immutable events or records.

### Windowing #Aggregation #TimeBased #CountBased
Grouping stream elements into finite sets (windows) for processing.
#### Tumbling Windows #FixedWindows #NonOverlapping

#### Sliding Windows #OverlappingWindows #MovingAverage
Fixed-size windows that slide over the stream by a specified slide duration.
#### Session Windows #ActivityBased #GapBased
Group events based on periods of activity separated by inactivity gaps.
#### Global Windows #SingleWindow #EntireStream

### State Management #StatefulProcessing #Memory #Persistence
Managing and storing intermediate results or context across events.
#### Need for State #Aggregations #Joins #CEP
Why state is crucial for many stream processing tasks.
#### State Backends #Storage #FaultTolerance #RocksDB #Memory

#### Checkpointing & Snapshots #FaultTolerance #Recovery
Mechanisms for periodically saving state to enable recovery after failures.

### Watermarks #Completeness #EventTimeProgress #LateData
Signaling the progress of event time in the stream, helping to determine when windows can be closed.
#### Handling Late Data #Tardiness #AccuracyTradeoff
Strategies for dealing with events that arrive after their corresponding watermark.

### Triggers #WindowComputation #OutputControl
Specifying when the results of a window computation should be emitted.
#### Event Time Triggers #WatermarkBased
Trigger based on watermark progress.
#### Processing Time Triggers #WallClockBased
Trigger based on processing time progress.
#### Count Triggers #ElementBased

## Processing Semantics #Guarantees #Consistency #Reliability
Guarantees provided by the system regarding message processing in the face of failures.

Each record is processed one or more times. Duplicates can occur on failure/retry. Requires idempotent sinks or downstream deduplication.

### Exactly-Once #Ideal #Complex #Idempotency
Each record affects the final state exactly once, even with failures. Often achieved via transactional updates or idempotent operations combined with checkpointing.
