# II. Practical Implementation of CLIP

## Setting Up the Environment

### Installing Libraries

*   Installing necessary libraries (e.g., `torch`, `transformers`, `clip`).
*   Example: `pip install torch transformers clip`

### Loading Pre-trained CLIP Model

*   Downloading and loading a pre-trained CLIP model.
*   Example using `clip.load()`:
    ```python
    import clip
    import torch

    device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
    model, preprocess = clip.load("ViT-B/32", device=device)
    ```

## Encoding Text and Images

### Encoding Text

*   Using the CLIP model to encode text into embeddings.
*   Example:
    ```python
    text = clip.tokenize(["a photo of a cat", "a photo of a dog"]).to(device)
    text_features = model.encode_text(text)
    ```

### Encoding Images

*   Using the CLIP model to encode images into embeddings.
*   Preprocessing images using the `preprocess` function.
*   Example:
    ```python
    from PIL import Image
    image = preprocess(Image.open("cat.jpg")).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
    image_features = model.encode_image(image)
    ```

## Performing Zero-Shot Classification

### Creating Text Prompts for Classes

*   Defining text prompts representing the classes to be classified.
*   Example: `["a photo of a cat", "a photo of a dog", "a photo of a bird"]`

### Computing Similarity Scores

*   Calculating cosine similarity between image embeddings and text embeddings.
*   Using the similarity scores to predict the class.
*   Example:
    ```python
    text_features = model.encode_text(clip.tokenize(classes).to(device))
    image_features /= image_features.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
    text_features /= text_features.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
    similarity = (image_features @ text_features.T).squeeze().float()
    ```

### Evaluating Performance

*   Evaluating the accuracy of zero-shot classification on a dataset.
*   Comparing CLIP's performance to other zero-shot methods.
