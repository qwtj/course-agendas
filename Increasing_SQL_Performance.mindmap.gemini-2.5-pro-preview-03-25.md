# Increasing SQL Performance #Optimization #Database #SQL
Overview of techniques and strategies to make SQL queries and database operations run faster.

## Understanding Performance Bottlenecks #Diagnosis #Analysis #Metrics
Identifying where and why performance issues occur is the first step.
This involves understanding how the database executes queries and where time is spent.

### Query Execution Plans #ExplainPlan #QueryAnalysis #Optimizer
How the database intends to execute a query. Essential for diagnosing slow queries.
#### Reading Execution Plans #Interpretation #Tools
Understanding operators like scans, seeks, joins, sorts, aggregations.
#### Cost Estimation #Optimizer #Statistics
How the database estimates the resource cost of different execution plan options.
#### Execution Plan Tools #SQLServer #PostgreSQL #MySQL
Database-specific commands (`EXPLAIN`, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, `SET SHOWPLAN_XML ON`).

### Wait Statistics #PerformanceCounters #BottleneckIdentification #Concurrency
Analyzing what resources queries are waiting for (e.g., CPU, I/O, locks, memory).
#### Common Wait Types #IO #CPU #Locking #Memory
Identifying specific waits like `PAGEIOLATCH`, `LCK_M`, `SOS_SCHEDULER_YIELD`.
#### Analyzing Wait Stats #DMVs #SystemViews
Using database-specific views or functions to gather and analyze wait information over time.

### Performance Metrics #Monitoring #Baseline #KPIs
Key indicators of database health and performance.
#### Throughput #QueriesPerSecond #Transactions
Measuring the volume of work the database handles.

## Query Optimization Techniques #SQLTuning #CodeQuality #Efficiency
Rewriting SQL queries to make them more efficient.

### Efficient `SELECT` Statements #Projection #DataRetrieval
Selecting only necessary columns.
#### Avoid `SELECT *` #Bandwidth #ReadReduction
Reduces network traffic, I/O, and potentially memory usage.
#### Calculated Columns #ExpressionOptimization
Be mindful of complex calculations in the `SELECT` list, perform post-retrieval if possible.

### Effective `WHERE` Clauses #Filtering #Predicates #SARGability
Ensuring filters are efficient and can utilize indexes.
#### SARGable Predicates #IndexUsage #PerformanceKiller
Search ARGument-able. Ensuring conditions allow the optimizer to use indexes (e.g., avoid functions on indexed columns).
#### Operator Choice #Comparison #LIKE
Using appropriate operators (`=`, `>`, `<`, `BETWEEN`, `IN` vs `NOT IN`, `LIKE 'prefix%'` vs `LIKE '%pattern%'`).
#### Data Type Matching #ImplicitConversion #PerformanceImpact
Avoid comparing columns of different data types, which can prevent index usage due to implicit conversion.

### Optimizing `JOIN` Operations #DataCombination #RelationalAlgebra
Choosing the right join types and ensuring efficient join execution.
#### Join Types (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`, `CROSS`) #JoinLogic #Correctness
Understanding the logical differences and performance implications.
#### Join Conditions #IndexUsage #DataTypes
Ensuring join columns are indexed and have compatible data types.

Understanding that the optimizer determines join order, but hints can sometimes influence it (use with caution).

### Subquery Optimization #NestedQueries #Alternatives
Strategies for handling subqueries effectively.
#### Correlated vs. Non-correlated Subqueries #PerformanceDifference
Correlated subqueries can be significantly slower as they may execute per outer row.
#### Alternatives (JOINs, CTEs, Temporary Tables) #RewritingSQL #Readability
Often, subqueries can be rewritten using more efficient constructs.
#### `EXISTS` vs. `IN` #PerformanceComparison #Semantics
Understanding when `EXISTS` might be more performant than `IN`, especially for large lists or checking existence.

### `UNION` vs. `UNION ALL` #SetOperations #DuplicateRemoval
Understanding the performance difference. `UNION ALL` avoids the sort/hash operation needed to remove duplicates.

### Avoiding Functions in `WHERE` or `JOIN` #SARGability #IndexUsage
Applying functions to indexed columns usually prevents the index from being used effectively. Consider calculated columns or alternative query structures.

### Pagination Optimization #OFFSET #LIMIT #KeysetPagination
Efficiently retrieving subsets of large result sets.
#### `OFFSET`/`LIMIT` Performance Issues #LargeOffsets #FullScan
`OFFSET` can be slow for large offsets as the database still needs to process skipped rows.

Different index structures for different needs.
#### B-Tree Indexes #DefaultIndex #RangeQueries #Equality
Most common type, suitable for equality and range predicates.
#### Clustered Indexes #PhysicalOrder #TableStructure #SQLServer
Defines the physical storage order of the table data. Only one per table (common in SQL Server, implicit in MySQL InnoDB PRIMARY KEY).
#### Non-Clustered Indexes #Pointers #DataLookup
Contain index key values and pointers (row locators or clustered key values) to the actual data rows. Multiple allowed per table.
#### Hash Indexes #EqualityOnly #MemoryOptimized
Optimized for equality lookups (`=`). Not suitable for range queries. Often used in memory-optimized tables.
#### Full-Text Indexes #TextSearch #NaturalLanguage
Specialized indexes for searching text data using linguistic rules.
#### Spatial Indexes #GeographicData #LocationQueries
Indexes for querying data based on geographic location or geometric shapes.
#### Columnstore Indexes #DataWarehouse #Analytics #Compression
Optimized for analytical queries scanning large amounts of data, uses columnar storage and compression.

### Index Design Principles #BestPractices #Selectivity
Guidelines for creating effective indexes.
#### Index Selectivity #Cardinality #FilteringPower
Choosing columns that significantly narrow down the result set. High cardinality (many unique values) is generally good.
#### Index Key Order #ColumnOrder #FilteringEfficiency
Placing the most selective columns first in multi-column indexes, considering typical query predicates.
#### Covering Indexes #QueryOptimization #IOAvoidance
Indexes that include all columns required by a query (in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`), avoiding table lookups.
#### Included Columns #NonKeyColumns #CoveringIndexOptimization
Adding non-key columns to a non-clustered index to create covering indexes without adding them to the index key itself.
#### Filtered Indexes #PartialIndex #StorageEfficiency
Indexing only a subset of rows in a table based on a `WHERE` clause, saving space and maintenance overhead.

### Index Maintenance #Health #PerformanceDegradation
Keeping indexes healthy and effective.

#### Avoid Text/Blob for Frequent Searching #PerformanceKiller #IndexingIssues
Large object types are generally inefficient for searching/joining unless specific features like Full-Text Search are used.
#### Numeric vs. String for IDs #JoinPerformance #Storage
Using numeric types for primary/foreign keys is usually more efficient for joins and storage than string types.

### Table Partitioning #Scalability #Maintenance #LargeTables
Dividing large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces.
#### Horizontal Partitioning #RowSplitting #Range #List #Hash
Splitting a table by rows based on a partition key (e.g., by date range, region). Improves query performance by scanning only relevant partitions, eases maintenance.
#### Vertical Partitioning #ColumnSplitting #NormalizationVariant
Splitting a table by columns, often placing less frequently accessed or large columns into a separate table linked by the primary key.

### Views #Abstraction #Simplicity #PerformanceConsiderations
