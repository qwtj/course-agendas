# Group Theory in Cryptography #Overview #Mathematics #Security
An overview of the application of abstract algebraic structures, specifically groups, to the design and analysis of cryptographic systems.

## Foundations of Group Theory for Cryptography #Basics #Algebra #Theory
Core algebraic concepts necessary to understand group-based cryptography.

### Basic Definitions #Concept #Terminology
Fundamental terms and properties.
#### Group Axioms #Definition #Property
Closure, associativity, identity element, inverse element.
#### Abelian (Commutative) Groups #Property #Type
Groups where the operation order doesn't matter (a * b = b * a). Crucial for many cryptographic schemes.
#### Non-Abelian Groups #Property #Type
Groups where operation order matters (a * b != b * a). Less common in mainstream crypto but relevant in some areas (e.g., braid group cryptography).

### Key Group Properties #Concept #Mathematics
Essential characteristics of groups used in crypto.
#### Order of a Group #Definition #Metric
The number of elements in the group, denoted |G|.
#### Order of an Element #Definition #Metric
The smallest positive integer k such that g^k = e (identity element), denoted ord(g).
#### Subgroups #Concept #Structure
A subset of a group that is itself a group under the same operation.
#### Lagrange's Theorem #Theorem #Property
The order of any subgroup H of a finite group G divides the order of G. Also, the order of any element divides the order of the group.
#### Cyclic Groups #Type #Structure
Groups that can be generated by a single element (the generator). g, g^2, g^3, ... generates all elements.
#### Generators #Element #Concept
An element g in a group G such that every element in G can be expressed as g^k for some integer k.
#### Cosets #Concept #Structure
Partitions of a group related to a subgroup.
#### Homomorphisms and Isomorphisms #Mapping #Relation
Structure-preserving maps between groups. Isomorphisms indicate groups are structurally identical.

## Fundamental Hard Problems in Groups #Complexity #SecurityBasis #Problem
Computational problems believed to be hard in certain groups, forming the security basis for many cryptosystems.

### Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) #Problem #Hardness
Given a generator g and an element h = g^x in a cyclic group G, find the exponent x. The difficulty of DLP is central to many schemes.
#### DLP Variants #Problem #Specifics
Variations depending on the group structure.
#### Generic DLP Algorithms #Algorithm #Attack
Algorithms that work regardless of the specific group structure (e.g., Baby-step Giant-step, Pollard's Rho). Exponential complexity in group order.
#### Non-Generic/Specific DLP Algorithms #Algorithm #Attack
Algorithms exploiting specific group properties (e.g., Index Calculus for Z_p*, Pohlig-Hellman).

### Computational Diffie-Hellman Problem (CDH) #Problem #Hardness
Given g, g^a, and g^b in a group G, compute g^(ab). Believed to be hard if DLP is hard.
#### Relationship to DLP #Theory #Comparison
Solving DLP allows solving CDH. The converse is not generally known.

### Decisional Diffie-Hellman Problem (DDH) #Problem #Hardness #Assumption
Given g, g^a, g^b, and g^c in a group G, distinguish whether c = ab (mod |G|) or c is random.
#### Relationship to CDH #Theory #Comparison
Solving CDH allows solving DDH. The DDH assumption is stronger than the CDH assumption (i.e., DDH might be easy even if CDH is hard).
#### Groups where DDH is Easy #Example #Counterexample
Certain groups (e.g., using pairings) have efficient DDH solutions.

## Types of Groups Used in Cryptography #Implementation #Choice #Security

### Multiplicative Group of Integers Modulo n (Z_n*) #GroupType #Classic
The set of integers less than n and relatively prime to n, under multiplication modulo n.
#### Subgroup of Quadratic Residues #Structure #Specific
Often used in practice, particularly modulo a prime p (Z_p*).
#### Security Considerations #Vulnerability #Parameter
Requires large modulus n (or p) due to attacks like Index Calculus. Less efficient than ECC.

### Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field (F_q*) #GroupType #FieldTheory
The non-zero elements of a finite field F_q under multiplication.
#### Prime Fields (q=p, prime) #Specific #Common
Corresponds to Z_p*.
#### Extension Fields (q=p^k) #Specific #Advanced
Used in some specific constructions, including pairing-based crypto.

### Elliptic Curve Groups (ECC) #GroupType #Modern #Efficiency
Points on an elliptic curve defined over a finite field, plus a point at infinity, under a specific addition law.
#### Curve Definition #Mathematics #Equation
Weierstrass equation (y^2 = x^3 + ax + b) and others.
#### Group Law #Operation #Geometric
Geometric chord-and-tangent rule for point addition.
#### Advantages #Benefit #Efficiency
Smaller key sizes for equivalent security compared to Z_p* or F_q*. Faster computations.
#### Standardization #Standards #Implementation
NIST curves, Brainpool curves, Curve25519, etc.

### Additive Groups (e.g., Z_n) #GroupType #LessCommon
Groups under addition modulo n. DLP is trivial (x = h * g^-1 mod n). Not directly used for DLP-based crypto but relevant in other contexts (e.g., lattice basis vectors).

### Other Groups #Advanced #Research
#### Braid Groups #NonAbelian #Research
Used in some proposed (less common) cryptosystems.
#### Matrix Groups #NonAbelian #Research
Groups of invertible matrices over finite fields.

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs #Privacy #Verification #Protocol
Protocols allowing one party (prover) to convince another (verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing anything beyond the truth of the statement itself. Many constructions rely on group-theoretic assumptions (e.g., Schnorr protocol for knowledge of discrete log).
