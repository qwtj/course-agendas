## Security Considerations #Security #Authentication #Network
Securing Memcached deployments.

### Network Security #Firewall #NetworkIsolation
*   Binding to specific interfaces (`-l`).
*   Using Firewalls (iptables, security groups) to restrict access.
*   Running Memcached in trusted networks.
*   **Warning:** Default Memcached has no encryption! Data travels in plaintext.

### Authentication #SASL #Authentication
*   Enabling SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer).
*   Configuring SASL mechanisms (e.g., PLAIN).
*   Client library support for SASL.
*   Managing credentials.

### Encryption #Encryption #TLS #Security
*   Memcached core does not natively support TLS/SSL encryption for traffic.
*   Solutions:
    *   Using proxies that support TLS termination (e.g., mcrouter, envoy, stunnel).
    *   Network-level encryption (VPN, IPsec).

### Preventing Amplification Attacks #Security #UDP #DDoS
*   Disabling UDP (`-U 0`) if not strictly needed.
*   Firewall rules to prevent spoofed source IPs.

### Operational Security #BestPractices #Security
*   Disabling dangerous commands (`flush_all` via `-F`).
*   Running Memcached with a dedicated, unprivileged user.
*   Regular security audits and patching.

## Advanced Features and Techniques #Advanced #Features #Optimization

### Binary Protocol #BinaryProtocol #Performance
*   Advantages over text protocol (lower overhead, reduced parsing).
*   Client library support required.
*   When to use it.

### Compare-and-Swap (CAS) #Concurrency #OptimisticLocking
*   Preventing race conditions during read-modify-write cycles.
*   Using `gets` and `cas` commands.
*   Use cases: Counters, shared state updates.

### Multi-Get Operations #Performance #Batching
*   Fetching multiple keys in a single request (`get key1 key2 ...`).
*   Reducing network round trips and client-side latency.

### `touch` Command #Expiration #Management
*   Updating item TTL without retrieving the value.
*   Use cases: Keeping frequently accessed items "alive".

### Namespacing Keys #Organization #Keys
*   Strategies for organizing keys to avoid collisions (e.g., `user:123:profile`, `product:456:details`).
*   Client library support for automated namespacing.

## Common Use Cases and Best Practices #UseCases #BestPractices #Patterns

### Database Query Caching #DBCaching #Performance
*   Caching results of expensive SQL queries.
*   Cache invalidation strategies (TTL, explicit deletion, write-through, write-aside).

### Session Management #Sessions #Web
*   Storing web session data.
*   Advantages over file-based or database sessions.

### API Rate Limiting #RateLimiting #API
*   Using `incr` with TTLs to track request counts per user/IP.

### Caching Rendered HTML Pages/Fragments #WebCaching #Performance

### Best Practices #Guidelines #Optimization
*   Cache only serializable data.
*   Use appropriate TTLs; avoid infinite caching where possible.
*   Monitor hit rates and evictions.
*   Implement robust error handling in clients (cache misses, server down).
*   Use consistent hashing for distributed setups.
*   Secure your Memcached instances.
*   Keep keys concise but descriptive.
*   Consider data compression in clients for large values.
*   Treat the cache as ephemeral; don't rely on it for primary data storage.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues #Troubleshooting #Debugging #Errors

### High Eviction Rates #Performance #Memory
*   Causes: Insufficient memory, poor TTL strategy, uneven key distribution.
*   Solutions: Increase memory (`-m`), optimize TTLs, improve hashing, analyze slab usage (`stats slabs`).

### High Cache Miss Rate #Performance #HitRate
*   Causes: Cache too small, frequent data changes, ineffective caching strategy, "cold" cache.
*   Solutions: Increase memory, review caching logic, implement warm-up strategies, check key distribution.

### Connection Issues #Connectivity #Errors
*   Causes: Firewall blocking, incorrect host/port, reaching connection limit (`-c`), network problems.
*   Solutions: Check firewall rules, verify client config, increase `-c`, diagnose network.

### Slow Performance #Latency #Performance
*   Causes: Network latency, server CPU saturation, excessive serialization/deserialization, inefficient client usage (e.g., no multi-get).
*   Solutions: Check network, monitor server resources, optimize client code, consider binary protocol.

### Data Consistency Problems #Consistency #Errors
*   Causes: Race conditions without CAS, incorrect cache invalidation.
*   Solutions: Use CAS for atomic updates, implement proper invalidation logic.

### Server Crashes or Unresponsiveness #Errors #Stability
*   Causes: Bugs, resource exhaustion (memory, file descriptors), OS issues.
*   Solutions: Check logs (`-v`), monitor system resources, ensure correct configuration, upgrade Memcached.
