# V. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

*   **Learning Objective:** Understand and apply the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction) using Java constructs.
*   **Section Transition:** This section delves deeper into the object-oriented nature of Java, explaining the fundamental principles and how they are implemented in the language.

## OOP Design Principles
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 2, introduce the four core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) as implemented in Java: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. Explain why these principles lead to better software design.</llm_prompt>"

### Encapsulation
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 3, define Encapsulation as the bundling of data (fields) and methods operating on that data within a single unit (class). Explain the concept of data hiding using access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`, default/package-private). Discuss the role of getter and setter methods.</llm_prompt>"
*   **Example:** "<llm_prompt>Show a `Person` class with private fields (`name`, `age`) and public getter/setter methods to illustrate encapsulation.</llm_prompt>"

### Inheritance
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 3, define Inheritance as a mechanism where a new class (subclass/child class) derives properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass/parent class). Explain the 'IS-A' relationship and code reuse benefits. Introduce the `extends` keyword.</llm_prompt>"
*   **Example:** "<llm_prompt>Show a `Dog` class extending an `Animal` class, inheriting methods like `eat()` and adding its own like `bark()`.</llm_prompt>"

### Polymorphism
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 3, define Polymorphism ('many forms') as the ability of an object to take on many forms. Explain its two main types in Java: Method Overriding (runtime polymorphism, achieved via inheritance) and Method Overloading (compile-time polymorphism, same method name with different parameters).</llm_prompt>"
*   **Example:** "<llm_prompt>Provide examples of method overriding (e.g., `Animal` sound vs. `Dog` sound) and method overloading (e.g., multiple `add` methods with different parameter types or counts).</llm_prompt>"

### Abstraction
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 3, define Abstraction as hiding implementation details and exposing only essential features. Explain how it is achieved in Java using abstract classes and interfaces.</llm_prompt>"

#### Abstract Classes
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 4, describe abstract classes defined with the `abstract` keyword. Explain that they cannot be instantiated directly and may contain abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must be implemented by concrete subclasses. Mention they can also have concrete methods and fields.</llm_prompt>"

#### Interfaces
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 4, describe interfaces defined with the `interface` keyword as contracts or blueprints. Explain that they traditionally contained only abstract methods (implicitly `public abstract`) and constants (implicitly `public static final`). Mention the addition of `default` and `static` methods since Java 8. Introduce the `implements` keyword.</llm_prompt>"
*   **Highlight:** Interfaces define *what* a class can do, while abstract classes can provide some *how*.

### `Object` Class
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 3, explain that `java.lang.Object` is the root superclass of all classes in Java. Describe common methods inherited from `Object`, such as `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`, and the importance of overriding them appropriately.</llm_prompt>"

### Constructors
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 3, define constructors as special methods used to initialize newly created objects. Explain how they are invoked using the `new` keyword, default constructors, overloaded constructors, and constructor chaining.</llm_prompt>"

### `this` and `super` Keywords
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 3, explain the use of the `this` keyword to refer to the current object instance (e.g., disambiguate instance variables from parameters, call other constructors). Explain the `super` keyword to refer to members (fields, methods, constructors) of the immediate superclass.</llm_prompt>"

*   **Reflective Prompt:** How do the OOP principles contribute to creating modular, maintainable, and extensible code? Compare and contrast abstract classes and interfaces – when would you use each?
*   **Glossary:**
    *   **Access Modifier:** Keywords (`public`, `private`, `protected`, default) that control the visibility of classes, fields, and methods.
    *   **Inheritance:** A mechanism where one class acquires the properties of another.
    *   **Polymorphism:** The ability of an object to take on many forms, typically through overriding and overloading.
    *   **Abstraction:** Hiding implementation details and showing only functionality.
    *   **Constructor:** A special method for initializing objects.
*   **Summary:** OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction) are central to Java. Understanding concepts like access modifiers, `extends`, `implements`, `abstract`, `interface`, `Object` class methods, constructors, `this`, and `super` is key to effective object-oriented design in Java.
*   **Further Reading:** [Link to Oracle's OOP Concepts tutorial], [Link to abstract classes vs. interfaces discussion]
*   **Quiz:** What are the four main principles of OOP? What is the difference between method overloading and overriding? What keyword is used for inheritance? What is the purpose of a constructor? Can you instantiate an abstract class?
