# Spring Boot Caching #Overview #SpringBoot #Performance
Provides an overview of caching within Spring Boot applications, leveraging the Spring Framework's caching abstraction. Aims to improve application performance by storing frequently accessed data in temporary storage.

## Introduction to Caching #Basics #Performance #Concept
Explains the fundamental reasons for using caching in software applications.
### Why Use Caching? #Motivation #Benefits
Discusses benefits like reduced latency, decreased load on backend systems (databases, APIs), improved throughput, and enhanced user experience.
### Common Caching Use Cases #Scenarios #Examples
Examples: Caching results of expensive database queries, responses from external APIs, frequently requested static content, computationally intensive results, user session data.
### Types of Caches #Categories #Architecture
Overview of different caching strategies: In-memory (local) vs. distributed caches, client-side vs. server-side caching, read-through, write-through, write-behind.
### Challenges in Caching #Problems #Considerations
Discusses potential issues like cache invalidation (keeping cache consistent with source), data consistency (stale data), cache coherency (in distributed systems), cache stampede (thundering herd problem), memory usage limitations, and configuration complexity.

## Spring Framework Caching Abstraction #Core #Abstraction #SpringFramework
Details the core components provided by the Spring Framework for generic caching support, independent of the underlying cache store.
### Key Concepts #Fundamentals #Terminology
Introduction to Spring's caching terminology and core interfaces.
#### Cache Interface #API #Contract
The central API representing a cache instance. Defines fundamental operations like `get(key)`, `put(key, value)`, `evict(key)`, `clear()`, `getName()`.
#### CacheManager Interface #Management #Configuration
Responsible for managing a collection of `Cache` instances. Handles the creation, retrieval, and lifecycle of named caches. Acts as a factory for Cache objects.
#### CacheResolver Interface #Resolution #Lookup
An abstraction for resolving the specific cache(s) to use for a given caching operation. Offers more dynamic resolution compared to static cache names in annotations.
#### KeyGenerator Interface #Keys #Identification
Responsible for generating cache keys based on method parameters when the default mechanism (based on parameter `hashCode`/`equals`) is insufficient or needs customization.

## Enabling Caching in Spring Boot #Setup #Configuration #Bootstrap
How to activate and configure Spring Boot's auto-configuration for caching.
### `@EnableCaching` Annotation #Activation #Annotation
The primary annotation placed on a Spring `@Configuration` class to enable Spring's caching capabilities and trigger auto-configuration.
### Auto-Configuration Magic #SpringBoot #AutoConfig
Explains how Spring Boot automatically detects cache providers (like EhCache, Caffeine, Redis) on the classpath and configures a suitable `CacheManager` bean if one doesn't exist explicitly.
### Selecting a Cache Provider #Choice #Dependency
Details how Spring Boot prioritizes providers based on dependencies present (e.g., JCache, EhCache 2.x, Hazelcast, Infinispan, Couchbase, Redis, Caffeine, Simple). Can be explicitly set via properties.

## Declarative Caching with Annotations #Annotations #Declarative #AOP
Using annotations to apply caching logic transparently to methods via Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP). This is the most common way to use caching in Spring.
### `@Cacheable` #ReadThrough #Retrieve
Indicates that the result of invoking a method (or all methods in a class) can be cached. Before the method executes, Spring checks the cache; if an entry exists for the key, it's returned immediately without executing the method. If not, the method executes, and its return value is cached.
#### `key` Attribute #Identification #SpEL
Specifies how the cache key is generated using SpEL (Spring Expression Language). Defaults to using method parameters.
#### `cacheNames` / `value` Attribute #Target #Storage
Specifies the name(s) of the cache(s) where the data should be stored and retrieved.
### `@CachePut` #WriteThrough #Update
Always executes the annotated method and updates the cache with the method's return value using the generated key. Useful for ensuring the cache is updated after modifying data, without interfering with method execution.
### `@CacheEvict` #Invalidation #Remove
Indicates that one or more entries should be removed from the cache when the annotated method is executed.
#### `allEntries` Attribute #ClearCache #BulkRemoval
A boolean flag (default `false`). If set to `true`, all entries in the specified cache(s) are removed, ignoring the specific key.
#### `beforeInvocation` Attribute #Timing #ExecutionFlow
Specifies whether eviction should occur *before* the method executes (if `true`) or *after* (if `false`, default). Evicting after ensures the cache is cleared only if the method completes successfully.
### `@Caching` #MultipleAnnotations #Grouping
Allows multiple caching annotations (`@Cacheable`, `@CachePut`, `@CacheEvict`) of the same or different types to be applied to a single method. Useful for complex caching logic on one operation.
### `@CacheConfig` #ClassLevel #Defaults
Defines default caching settings (like `cacheNames`, `keyGenerator`, `cacheManager`, `cacheResolver`) at the class level, reducing redundancy in method-level annotations within that class.

## Conditional Caching #Conditions #Logic #Filtering
Applying caching operations selectively based on runtime conditions using SpEL expressions.
### `condition` Attribute #PreCondition #Cacheable #CachePut #CacheEvict
A SpEL expression evaluated *before* method execution. If the expression evaluates to `false`, the caching operation (get, put, or evict) is completely skipped. Useful for caching only based on specific input parameters (e.g., `condition = "#id > 10"`).
### `unless` Attribute #PostCondition #Cacheable #CachePut
A SpEL expression evaluated *after* the method has been invoked and a result has been obtained. If the expression evaluates to `true`, the result is *not* placed in the cache (for `@Cacheable`, `@CachePut`). Useful for preventing the caching of certain outcomes (e.g., `unless = "#result == null"`).
### Using SpEL Expressions #SpEL #Expressions #Dynamic
Leveraging the Spring Expression Language provides access to method arguments (`#argName` or `#p0`, `#p1`, etc.), the result (`#result`), beans (`@beanName`), and other context information for powerful conditional logic.

## Key Generation Strategies #Keys #Uniqueness #Generation
Defines how unique keys are created to identify entries within a cache. Proper key generation is crucial for cache correctness.
### Default Key Generation #SimpleKeyGenerator #DefaultBehavior
If no key or keyGenerator is specified, Spring uses a default strategy. For methods with no parameters, it uses `SimpleKey.EMPTY`. For one parameter, it uses the parameter instance itself. For multiple parameters, it uses a `SimpleKey` containing all parameters. Relies heavily on parameter `hashCode()` and `equals()` implementations.
### Custom Key Generation #CustomLogic #KeyGenerator
Implementing the `org.springframework.cache.interceptor.KeyGenerator` interface for complex scenarios where the default strategy is insufficient (e.g., keys based on specific object fields, combinations, or external context).
#### Implementing `KeyGenerator` Interface #SPI #CustomBean
Creating a Spring bean that implements the `generate(Object target, Method method, Object... params)` method.
#### Specifying a Custom `KeyGenerator` #Configuration #Annotation
Referencing the custom `KeyGenerator` bean name in the `keyGenerator` attribute of caching annotations or `@CacheConfig`.
### Using SpEL for Keys #SpEL #Expressions #KeyAttribute
Specifying a SpEL expression directly in the `key` attribute of caching annotations (`@Cacheable`, `@CachePut`, `@CacheEvict`) for fine-grained, inline control over key generation based on method arguments (e.g., `key = "#user.id"` or `key = "'user:'.concat(#id)"`).

## Cache Configuration #Setup #Customization #Properties
Configuring the underlying cache manager and specific cache instances.
### Spring Boot Properties (`application.properties`/`yml`) #ExternalConfig #SpringBoot
Leveraging Spring Boot's externalized configuration via `application.properties` or `application.yml` files.
#### `spring.cache.type` #ProviderSelection #Explicit
Explicitly sets the desired cache provider implementation (e.g., `redis`, `caffeine`, `ehcache`, `hazelcast`, `none`, `simple`). Overrides classpath detection.
#### `spring.cache.cache-names` #PredefinedCaches #Initialization
Provides a comma-separated list of cache names that Spring Boot should ensure are created on startup (supported by some cache managers like EhCache, Caffeine, Hazelcast).
#### Provider-Specific Properties #Vendor #FineTuning
Namespace properties specific to the chosen provider (e.g., `spring.cache.redis.*` for Redis TTL, key prefix, serialization; `spring.cache.caffeine.spec` for Caffeine size/expiry specification).
### Java-based Configuration (`@Configuration`) #JavaConfig #BeanDefinition
Programmatically defining `CacheManager` and related beans using Java `@Configuration` classes for maximum control and complex setups.
#### Defining Custom `CacheManager` Beans #Bean #Override
Providing your own `CacheManager` bean definition disables the auto-configured one, giving full control over its setup and the underlying cache library's configuration.
#### Customizing Auto-configured `CacheManager` #Callback #SpringBoot #Customizer
Implementing `CacheManagerCustomizer<T>` beans (where T is the specific CacheManager type, e.g., `RedisCacheManager`) allows tweaking the auto-configured `CacheManager` without replacing it entirely.

## Supported Cache Providers #Integration #Vendors #Ecosystem
Overview of common caching libraries that Spring Boot integrates with via its auto-configuration.
### Generic (No specific library required) #Default #Simple
#### `none` #DisableCaching
Explicitly disables caching entirely (`spring.cache.type=none`).
#### `simple` #InMemory #ConcurrentMapCacheManager
The default provider if no other is found on the classpath. Uses `ConcurrentHashMap` instances for caches. Simple, but lacks features like size limits, eviction policies, persistence, or distribution. Generally not recommended for production.
### JCache (JSR-107) #Standard #API #javax.cache
Integration with the standard Java Caching API (JSR-107). Requires a JSR-107 compliant caching library implementation on the classpath (e.g., EhCache 3, Hazelcast, Infinispan).
### EhCache 2.x #InMemory #Distributed #Legacy
Integration support for EhCache version 2.x. Typically configured via an `ehcache.xml` file on the classpath.
### EhCache 3.x #InMemory #Distributed #JCache #Current
Integration via the JCache (JSR-107) standard. Configuration usually managed through the JCache API or Ehcache 3 specific XML/programmatic configuration.
### Hazelcast #InMemoryDataGrid #Distributed #IMDG
Integration with Hazelcast IMDG. Spring Boot can auto-configure a `HazelcastInstance` (either client or embedded server) and a JCache-compliant `CacheManager` based on Hazelcast.
### Infinispan #InMemoryDataGrid #Distributed #IMDG #JBoss
Integration support for Infinispan, another distributed cache/data grid solution. Auto-configuration is available.
### Redis #Distributed #KeyValueStore #Remote
Integration with Redis, a popular remote key-value store. Requires a Redis server and a Java client (Lettuce - default, or Jedis). Auto-configures `RedisCacheManager`. Highly suitable for distributed caching.
### Caffeine #InMemory #HighPerformance #Java
Integration with Caffeine, a high-performance, near-optimal Java 8 in-memory cache library. Often the preferred choice for local, in-memory caching needs. Auto-configures `CaffeineCacheManager`.
### Couchbase #NoSQL #Distributed #DocumentDB
Integration support for using Couchbase Server as a caching backend.

## Provider-Specific Configuration Details #DeepDive #Configuration #Examples
More detailed examples and options for configuring popular cache providers within Spring Boot.
### Caffeine Configuration #Caffeine #InMemory #Spec
Using `spring.cache.caffeine.spec` property with a spec string (e.g., `maximumSize=500,expireAfterAccess=600s`) or defining `CaffeineSpec` or `Caffeine<Object, Object>` beans for programmatic configuration. Configuring maximum size (entries or weight), expiry (time-to-live, time-to-idle), weak/soft references for keys/values.
### Redis Configuration #Redis #Distributed #Serialization
Configuring Redis connection details via `spring.redis.*` properties. Customizing cache behavior via `spring.cache.redis.*` properties: `time-to-live` (default TTL for entries), `key-prefix` (namespace keys), `use-key-prefix`, `cache-null-values`. Defining a `RedisCacheConfiguration` bean for advanced settings like serialization format (default is JDK, consider JSON with `GenericJackson2JsonRedisSerializer` for interoperability).
### EhCache Configuration #Ehcache #XML #JCache
For EhCache 2.x, relies on an `ehcache.xml` file found at the root of the classpath. For EhCache 3.x, typically configured via JCache mechanisms (`javax.cache.configuration.Configuration`) or Ehcache 3's native XML/programmatic configuration managed outside or inside Spring.
### Hazelcast Configuration #Hazelcast #IMDG #Networking
Configuring Hazelcast instances (client/server mode), network settings (discovery mechanisms), and map configurations (backing the caches) often via `hazelcast.yaml`/`hazelcast.xml` or `hazelcast-client.yaml`/`hazelcast-client.xml` files, or programmatically via `Config` or `ClientConfig` beans.

## Programmatic Cache Management #API #DirectAccess #Control
Interacting with the cache infrastructure directly through Java code, bypassing annotations.
### Injecting `CacheManager` #DependencyInjection #Access
Autowiring the configured `CacheManager` bean into your services or components.
### Retrieving a `Cache` Instance #Lookup #ByName
Obtaining a specific `Cache` object from the manager using its name: `Cache cache = cacheManager.getCache("myCache");`.
### Manual Cache Operations #CRUD #APIUsage
Using the methods provided by the `Cache` interface directly in your code: `cache.get(key)`, `cache.put(key, value)`, `cache.evict(key)`, `cache.clear()`. Provides fine-grained control over cache interactions.
### Use Cases for Programmatic Access #Scenarios #Flexibility
Situations where annotations are insufficient: complex conditional logic not easily expressible in SpEL, dynamic cache name resolution, bulk operations, interacting with caches outside of method execution boundaries (e.g., in event listeners, background jobs).

## JCache (JSR-107) Integration #JSR107 #Standard #javax.cache
Leveraging the Java standard caching API (JSR-107) within Spring Boot applications.
### `@EnableCaching` and JSR-107 #Activation #StandardAnnotations
The standard `@EnableCaching` annotation also enables processing of JSR-107 caching annotations if a JSR-107 implementation and the `cache-api` dependency are present.
### JSR-107 Annotations #StandardAnnotations #API
Using standard annotations like `@javax.cache.annotation.CacheResult`, `@javax.cache.annotation.CachePut`, `@javax.cache.annotation.CacheRemove`, `@javax.cache.annotation.CacheRemoveAll`, `@javax.cache.annotation.CacheDefaults`. These offer similar functionality to Spring's annotations but adhere to the Java standard.
### Configuring a JSR-107 Provider #Setup #Dependency
Including a JSR-107 compliant library (like EhCache 3, Hazelcast, Infinispan) and the `javax.cache:cache-api` dependency on the classpath. Spring Boot will auto-configure a `javax.cache.CacheManager` if `spring.cache.type=jcache`.
### Bridging Spring and JCache #Compatibility #Adapter
Spring Boot provides seamless integration, allowing mixing of Spring and JCache annotations. Spring's `JCacheCacheManager` adapts a JSR-107 `CacheManager` to Spring's `CacheManager` interface.

## Advanced Caching Concepts #Advanced #Techniques #Patterns
Exploring more sophisticated caching strategies and considerations beyond basic usage.
### Cache Synchronization #Consistency #Updates
Strategies to keep caches synchronized with the source of truth, especially challenging in distributed environments. Techniques include explicit invalidation (`@CacheEvict`), short TTLs, using `@CachePut` on update methods, or leveraging provider-specific features like distributed event listeners or messaging queues.
### Cache Eviction Policies #Eviction #MemoryManagement
Understanding and configuring algorithms used by the cache provider to remove entries when limits (size or time) are reached. Common policies include Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU), First-In, First-Out (FIFO). Configuration is provider-specific (e.g., via Caffeine spec, EhCache XML).
### Time-To-Live (TTL) vs Time-To-Idle (TTI) #Expiration #Policies
TTL (Time-To-Live): Maximum time an entry can stay in the cache since it was created. TTI (Time-To-Idle): Maximum time an entry can stay in the cache since it was last accessed. Configuring these helps manage memory and data freshness automatically.
### Handling Cache Misses #Miss #Performance
Strategies for efficiently handling the scenario where requested data is not found in the cache. Includes optimizing the data retrieval logic itself and potentially implementing mechanisms like single-flight loading (preventing multiple threads from loading the same missing key simultaneously) to avoid cache stampedes.
### Cache Warming / Pre-loading #Initialization #Preloading
Proactively populating the cache with frequently accessed data on application startup or before anticipated peak load to improve initial response times. Can be done via background jobs or lifecycle listeners.
### Multi-Level Caching #TieredCaching #Performance
Implementing multiple layers of caches, typically a fast local in-memory cache (L1) backed by a larger, shared distributed cache (L2). Reduces latency for frequently hit items and lessens load on the distributed cache. Requires careful implementation or specific library support.
### Cache Loaders and Writers (Read/Write-Through, Write-Behind) #SystemOfRecord #Synchronization
Mechanisms (often part of JCache standard or provider-specific features) that allow the cache to automatically interact with the underlying system of record (e.g., database).
#### Read-Through #CacheLoader #OnDemandLoading
Cache automatically loads data from the backend upon a cache miss.
#### Write-Through #CacheWriter #SynchronousUpdate
Cache synchronously writes updates through to the backend system when a cache entry is modified.
#### Write-Behind #CacheWriter #AsynchronousUpdate
Cache updates are asynchronously written to the backend system, improving write performance but potentially leading to temporary inconsistency.
### Serialization Considerations #Serialization #DistributedCache #Compatibility
Choosing appropriate data serialization mechanisms (Java Serialization, JSON, Protobuf, Kryo, Avro) is crucial, especially for distributed caches. Factors include performance, storage size, cross-language compatibility, and schema evolution. Configuration often involves setting up custom `RedisSerializer` beans for Redis.

## Caching Best Practices & Patterns #Guidelines #Recommendations #Efficiency
Provides practical advice and established patterns for implementing caching effectively.
### Identify Cache Candidates #WhatToCache #Analysis
Focus on data that is: expensive to compute/retrieve, frequently accessed, and changes infrequently (read-heavy workloads). Analyze access patterns.
### Choose the Right Cache Type #InMemory #Distributed #Decision
Select between local in-memory (Caffeine, EhCache) for single-node performance boosts or distributed (Redis, Hazelcast) for scalability, data sharing across nodes, and fault tolerance. Consider the trade-offs.
### Cache Granularity #DataSize #Scope
Decide whether to cache entire complex objects or only specific, frequently needed attributes. Caching finer-grained data can reduce memory usage and simplify invalidation but might require more cache interactions. Caching collections requires careful key and invalidation strategies.
### Effective Cache Key Strategy #KeyDesign #Uniqueness
Design keys that are unique, deterministic, and descriptive. Avoid overly complex keys that are slow to compute. Use prefixes for namespacing in shared caches. Ensure key objects have correct `equals()` and `hashCode()` implementations.
### Consistent Cache Invalidation Strategy #StaleData #Consistency
Choose an appropriate method to keep cache data fresh: Time-based expiration (TTL/TTI) is simple but allows for staleness. Explicit eviction (`@CacheEvict`, programmatic eviction) provides more control but is harder to get right. Consider event-driven invalidation for distributed systems.
### Error Handling & Resilience #Resilience #Failures
Plan for cache unavailability (especially with distributed caches). Decide if cache failures should propagate exceptions or if the application should gracefully fallback to fetching from the source. Use timeouts and potentially circuit breakers.
### Performance Monitoring and Tuning #Metrics #Tuning
Regularly monitor cache metrics: hit ratio, miss ratio, eviction count, cache size, latency of get/put operations. Use this data to tune cache sizes, expiration times, and eviction policies.
### Avoid Caching Large Objects Unnecessarily #Memory #Performance
Be mindful of memory consumption, especially for in-memory caches. Large objects increase GC pressure and eviction frequency. Consider caching only essential data or using techniques like compression (if supported by the provider).
### Understand AOP Proxy Limitations #AOP #SelfInvocation
Caching annotations rely on Spring AOP proxies. Calls to annotated methods *from within the same class* bypass the proxy and thus ignore the caching logic. Ensure cached methods are called from other Spring beans.

## Testing Caching Implementations #Testing #QualityAssurance #Verification
Strategies for writing unit and integration tests to verify caching behavior.
### Unit Testing Cached Services #Isolation #Mocking
Test the business logic of the service method itself, mocking dependencies. Generally, you don't test the caching annotation directly in a pure unit test; you verify the service's logic assuming caching works.
### Integration Testing with Caching #SpringBootTest #RealCache
Create integration tests using `@SpringBootTest` to load the application context, enabling the processing of caching annotations.
#### Using Test-Specific Cache Configurations #TestProfile #InMemoryTest
Configure a simple cache manager (like `SimpleCacheManager` or `CaffeineCacheManager`) specifically for tests, even if production uses a different one (e.g., Redis). Use Spring Profiles (`@ActiveProfiles("test")`) to manage test configurations.
#### Using Embedded Caches or Testcontainers #EmbeddedRedis #TestContainers
For testing interactions with distributed caches like Redis, use embedded versions (e.g., embedded-redis) or Testcontainers to spin up real cache instances in Docker containers managed by the test lifecycle.
#### Verifying Cache Hits and Misses #Assertions #Behavior #SpyBean
Inject the `CacheManager` or specific `Cache` instances into your tests to assert their state (e.g., `cache.get(key)` returns a non-null value after a supposed cache population). Use `@SpyBean` on the cached service to verify if the actual method implementation was invoked (cache miss) or skipped (cache hit) using Mockito's `verify()` methods.
#### Clearing Caches Between Tests #Isolation #TestContext #DirtiesContext
Ensure tests are isolated by clearing caches before or after each test method (`@BeforeEach`/`@AfterEach` using `cacheManager.getCacheNames().forEach(name -> cacheManager.getCache(name).clear())`). Alternatively, use `@DirtiesContext` on test methods or classes to reset the Spring context (including caches), though this is slower.

## Monitoring and Metrics #Monitoring #Observability #Actuator
Observing cache performance and behavior in running applications using Spring Boot Actuator and Micrometer.
### Spring Boot Actuator Cache Endpoint #Actuator #Metrics #Management
Exposing the `/actuator/caches` endpoint (requires `spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependency) provides runtime information about the configured `CacheManager`(s) and the names of the caches they manage. Limited metrics might be available here depending on the provider.
### Micrometer Cache Metrics #Micrometer #MetricsCollection #TimeSeries
When Micrometer (`micrometer-core`) is on the classpath along with Actuator, Spring Boot automatically instruments supported cache implementations (Caffeine, EhCache2, Hazelcast, Infinispan, Redis) to collect detailed metrics.
#### Common Cache Metrics #KeyMetrics #PerformanceIndicators
Metrics typically include: cache size (`cache.size`), hit count/ratio (`cache.gets[result=hit]`), miss count/ratio (`cache.gets[result=miss]`), put count (`cache.puts`), eviction count (`cache.evictions`).
#### Configuring and Viewing Metrics #Enablement #Properties #ActuatorMetrics
Metrics are usually enabled by default. They can be viewed via the `/actuator/metrics` endpoint (e.g., `/actuator/metrics/cache.gets`). Provider-specific configuration might be needed in some cases.
#### Exporting Metrics to Monitoring Systems #Prometheus #Grafana #Datadog #JMX
Integrate Micrometer with monitoring systems (like Prometheus, Graphite, Datadog, InfluxDB) by adding the corresponding `micrometer-registry-*` dependency. This allows for visualization, dashboarding (e.g., in Grafana), and alerting based on cache performance trends. JMX exposure is also possible.
### Provider-Specific Monitoring Tools #VendorTools #ManagementCenter
Utilizing monitoring capabilities provided directly by the cache vendor (e.g., Redis CLI commands like `MONITOR`, `INFO`, Hazelcast Management Center, EhCache monitoring extensions).

## Distributed Caching Considerations #Distributed #Scalability #Consistency
Addressing specific challenges and trade-offs when using distributed caches like Redis, Hazelcast, or Memcached across multiple application instances.
### Network Latency & Reliability #Performance #RemoteCall #Failure
Accessing a remote cache inherently involves network latency, which can be significant compared to in-memory access. Network partitions or cache server failures can impact application availability. Design for resilience (timeouts, fallbacks).
### Serialization Overhead and Format #DataFormat #Performance #Size
Data stored in distributed caches must be serialized and deserialized. The choice of serialization format (Java, JSON, Kryo, Protobuf) significantly impacts performance and storage size. JSON is human-readable but can be verbose; binary formats are often faster and smaller.
### Data Consistency & Coherency #Synchronization #CAPTheorem #StaleData
Ensuring that all application nodes see a consistent view of the cached data is challenging. Updates made by one node need to be visible to others, and invalidation signals must propagate correctly. Understand the consistency guarantees of the chosen cache provider and potential trade-offs (CAP Theorem).
### Fault Tolerance & Availability #Availability #FailureModes #Redundancy
Distributed caches can become single points of failure if not set up redundantly (e.g., Redis Sentinel/Cluster, Hazelcast clustering). Application logic should handle cache unavailability gracefully.
### Scalability & Capacity Planning #Clustering #Sharding #Sizing
The distributed cache itself needs to scale to handle the load from all application instances. This involves planning for memory capacity, CPU, network bandwidth, and potentially using clustering or sharding features provided by the cache system.
### Security #Authentication #Encryption #Authorization
Securing access to the distributed cache (authentication, authorization) and potentially encrypting data in transit and at rest is crucial, especially if sensitive data is cached.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues #Debugging #Problems #Solutions
Diagnosing and fixing frequent problems encountered when implementing Spring Boot Caching.
### Cache Not Working / Annotations Ignored #Debugging #Setup #AOP
Verify `@EnableCaching` is present on a `@Configuration` class. Ensure the cache provider dependency is correctly added and configured (`spring.cache.type` or auto-detected). Check for AOP proxy issues: Ensure the cached method is `public` and called from *another* Spring bean (self-invocation bypasses the cache proxy). Check logs for cache-related errors or warnings.
### Stale Data in Cache #Invalidation #Consistency #TTL
Incorrect `@CacheEvict` logic (wrong key, condition, `beforeInvocation` setting). TTL/TTI set too long. Lack of proper synchronization/invalidation in a distributed environment after database updates occur outside the cached methods. Debug invalidation logic and timing.
### Serialization Errors (`ClassNotFoundException`, etc.) #ClassNotFound #Compatibility #Redis #Distributed
Common in distributed caches (Redis) or during application restarts/updates. Ensure the class definition is available to the application doing deserialization. Ensure serializer compatibility (e.g., using Jackson JSON serializer requires classes to be JSON-serializable). Check if class structure changed between serialization and deserialization. Configure appropriate serializers (e.g., `GenericJackson2JsonRedisSerializer`).
### Incorrect Key Generation / Cache Collisions #Collisions #KeyDesign #HashCodeEquals
Default key generation relies on `hashCode()`/`equals()`. Ensure these methods are correctly implemented for custom key objects or parameters. Use `@Cacheable(key = "...")` with SpEL or a custom `KeyGenerator` for precise control. Debug the generated keys by logging them or inspecting the cache.
### High Memory Usage / Memory Leaks #MemoryManagement #Eviction #Sizing
For in-memory caches (Caffeine, EhCache): Ensure proper size limits (maximum number of entries or maximum weight) and eviction policies are configured. Caching excessively large objects or objects with complex graphs can consume significant heap space. Use profiling tools (like JVisualVM, YourKit) to analyze heap usage.
### Unexpected `NullPointerException` or Errors #CacheNullValues #ErrorHandling
By default, `null` return values from methods are often cached. Subsequent calls might retrieve this cached `null`, potentially causing NPEs downstream. Configure `cache-null-values` property (e.g., `spring.cache.redis.cache-null-values=false`) or use the `unless="#result == null"` condition. Also, handle exceptions thrown by the cache provider itself (e.g., Redis connection errors).
### Performance Degradation #Latency #Tuning #Serialization
Cache access becomes slow. Could be due to network latency (distributed cache), expensive serialization/deserialization, slow key generation logic, or contention within the cache provider itself. Monitor cache operation timings and tune configurations.
