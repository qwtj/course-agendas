# I. Introduction to Version Control

## Understanding Version Control Systems (VCS)

### Definition and Purpose of Version Control
*   Tracking changes to files over time.
*   Collaboration among multiple developers.
*   Reverting to previous versions of code.
*   Managing different versions of a software project.

### Types of Version Control Systems
*   Local Version Control: Simple database to keep track of file changes.
*   Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS):
    *   Examples: Subversion (SVN), Perforce.
    *   Single central server to store all file versions.
    *   Drawbacks: Single point of failure.
*   Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS):
    *   Examples: Git, Mercurial.
    *   Each developer has a full copy of the repository.
    *   Allows offline work and better redundancy.

## Introduction to Git

### What is Git?
*   A distributed version control system.
*   Focus on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed workflows.
*   Written by Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux).

### Git's Core Concepts
*   Repositories: Storage location for project files and their history.
*   Commits: Snapshots of the repository at a specific point in time.
*   Branches: Independent lines of development.
*   Merging: Combining changes from different branches.

# II. Setting up Git

## Installing Git

### Downloading Git
*   Downloading the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) from the official Git website: git-scm.com

### Installation Process
*   Following the installation instructions for your operating system.
*   Choosing appropriate installation options (e.g., default text editor, PATH settings).

### Verifying Installation
*   Opening a terminal or command prompt.
*   Running the command `git --version` to confirm that Git is installed and accessible.

## Configuring Git

### Setting User Information
*   Configuring your name and email address:
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
    ```
*   Why this information is important for attribution of commits.

### Configuring Text Editor
*   Setting your preferred text editor for commit messages:
    ```bash
    git config --global core.editor "nano"  # Example: using nano
    git config --global core.editor "vim"   # Example: using vim
    git config --global core.editor "code --wait" # Example: using Visual Studio Code
    ```

### Configuring Other Options
*   Checking current configuration: `git config --list`
*   Setting default branch name `git config --global init.defaultBranch main`

# III. Basic Git Commands

## Creating a Repository

### Initializing a New Repository
*   Navigating to your project directory in the terminal.
*   Running the command `git init` to create a new Git repository.
*   Understanding the `.git` directory and its contents (configuration files, object database, etc.).

### Cloning an Existing Repository
*   Using the command `git clone <repository_url>` to copy a remote repository to your local machine.
*   Example: `git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git`

## Staging and Committing Changes

### The Staging Area (Index)
*   Understanding the staging area as a place to prepare changes for commit.

### Adding Files to the Staging Area
*   Using the command `git add <file>` to add specific files to the staging area.
*   Example: `git add myfile.txt`
*   Using `git add .` to add all modified and new files in the current directory.

### Committing Changes
*   Using the command `git commit -m "Your commit message"` to create a commit with a descriptive message.
*   Importance of writing clear and concise commit messages.
*   Using `git commit` without the `-m` flag to open a text editor for writing a longer commit message.

### Checking the Status
*   Using the command `git status` to view the status of your files (modified, staged, committed).

## Viewing History

### Viewing Commit History
*   Using the command `git log` to display the commit history.
*   Understanding the information provided by `git log` (commit hash, author, date, commit message).

### Viewing Specific Commits
*   Using `git show <commit_hash>` to view the details of a specific commit.
*   Example: `git show a1b2c3d4e5f67890`

### Comparing Changes
*   Using `git diff` to see the changes between the working directory and the staging area.
*   Using `git diff --staged` to see the changes between the staging area and the last commit.
*   Using `git diff <commit1> <commit2>` to compare two specific commits.

# IV. Branching and Merging

## Understanding Branches

### What are Branches?
*   Independent lines of development within a Git repository.
*   Allowing parallel development without affecting the main codebase.

### Creating Branches
*   Using the command `git branch <branch_name>` to create a new branch.
*   Example: `git branch feature/new-feature`

### Switching Between Branches
*   Using the command `git checkout <branch_name>` to switch to a different branch.
*   Example: `git checkout feature/new-feature`
*   Using `git checkout -b <branch_name>` to create and switch to a new branch in one step.

### Listing Branches
*   Using the command `git branch` to list all local branches.
*   Using `git branch -a` to list all local and remote branches.

## Merging Branches

### What is Merging?
*   Combining changes from one branch into another.

### Performing a Merge
*   Switching to the target branch (e.g., `main`).
*   Using the command `git merge <branch_name>` to merge the specified branch into the current branch.
*   Example: `git checkout main; git merge feature/new-feature`

### Resolving Merge Conflicts
*   Identifying merge conflicts (marked with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
*   Manually editing the conflicted files to resolve the conflicts.
*   Using `git add <file>` to stage the resolved files.
*   Using `git commit` to complete the merge.

## Branching Strategies

### Gitflow Workflow
*   Using `main`, `develop`, `feature`, `release`, and `hotfix` branches.
*   Detailed rules for merging between branches.

### GitHub Flow
*   Using `main` and feature branches.
*   Simpler and more streamlined than Gitflow.

### Trunk-Based Development
*   Committing directly to the `main` branch.
*   Requires strong testing and continuous integration.

# V. Working with Remote Repositories

## Connecting to Remote Repositories

### Adding a Remote
*   Using the command `git remote add <remote_name> <remote_url>` to add a remote repository.
*   Example: `git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git`
*   `origin` is a conventional name for the main remote repository.

### Viewing Remotes
*   Using the command `git remote -v` to list the configured remote repositories and their URLs.

## Pushing Changes

### Pushing to a Remote
*   Using the command `git push <remote_name> <branch_name>` to push local commits to a remote repository.
*   Example: `git push origin main`
*   Using `git push -u origin main` to set the upstream branch for easier future pushes.

## Pulling Changes

### Fetching Changes
*   Using the command `git fetch <remote_name>` to retrieve changes from a remote repository without merging them.
*   Example: `git fetch origin`

### Pulling Changes
*   Using the command `git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>` to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.
*   Example: `git pull origin main`
*   Avoiding surprises: Understanding `git pull --rebase` vs. `git pull --merge`.

## Collaboration Workflow

### Forking a Repository
*   Creating a copy of a repository under your own account.

### Pull Requests
*   Submitting changes to the original repository via pull requests.
*   Reviewing pull requests submitted by others.
*   Merging pull requests after review.

# VI. Advanced Git Techniques

## Rebasing

### Understanding Rebasing
*   Moving a branch to a new base commit.
*   Creating a cleaner commit history.

### Performing a Rebase
*   Switching to the branch you want to rebase.
*   Using the command `git rebase <base_branch>` to rebase the branch onto the specified base branch.
*   Example: `git checkout feature/new-feature; git rebase main`

### Resolving Rebase Conflicts
*   Similar to resolving merge conflicts, but occurs during the rebasing process.
*   Using `git rebase --continue` to continue the rebase after resolving conflicts.
*   Using `git rebase --abort` to abort the rebase.

### Interactive Rebasing
*   Using `git rebase -i <commit_hash>` to interactively edit the commit history.
*   Allows to reorder, squash, edit, or drop commits.

## Stashing

### What is Stashing?
*   Temporarily saving changes that are not ready to be committed.

### Stashing Changes
*   Using the command `git stash` to stash your current changes.
*   Using the command `git stash save "description"` to add a description.

### Listing Stashes
*   Using the command `git stash list` to list all stashed changes.

### Applying Stashed Changes
*   Using the command `git stash apply stash@{n}` to apply a specific stash.
*   Using the command `git stash pop stash@{n}` to apply and remove a specific stash.

### Dropping Stashes
*   Using the command `git stash drop stash@{n}` to remove a specific stash.
*   Using the command `git stash clear` to remove all stashes.

## Undoing Changes

### Undoing Commits
*   Using the command `git revert <commit_hash>` to create a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by a specific commit.
*   Using the command `git reset --hard <commit_hash>` to reset the branch to a specific commit (use with caution).

### Amending Commits
*   Using the command `git commit --amend` to modify the last commit.
*   Adding changes to the staging area before running `git commit --amend`.

## Ignoring Files

### Creating a `.gitignore` File
*   Adding a `.gitignore` file to the root of your repository.
*   Specifying patterns for files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
*   Example `.gitignore` content:
    ```
    *.log
    /tmp/
    build/
    ```

### Understanding `.gitignore` Syntax
*   Using wildcards (`*`, `?`, `[]`) to match multiple files.
*   Using `/` to specify a directory.
*   Using `!` to negate a pattern (unignore a file).

# VII. Git Best Practices

## Commit Message Guidelines

### Writing Clear and Concise Commit Messages
*   Using a short, descriptive subject line (50 characters or less).
*   Separating the subject line from the body with a blank line.
*   Using the body to provide more detailed information about the changes.
*   Using imperative mood in the subject line ("Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").

## Branching Strategy Adherence

### Following a Consistent Branching Strategy
*   Ensuring that all developers are following the same branching strategy.
*   Using code reviews and pull requests to enforce the branching strategy.

## Regular Committing

### Committing Frequently
*   Breaking down large changes into smaller, logical commits.
*   Committing early and often to avoid losing work.

## Code Review

### Participating in Code Reviews
*   Reviewing code submitted by other developers.
*   Providing constructive feedback and suggestions.
*   Improving code quality and reducing bugs.

## Continuous Integration

### Integrating with Continuous Integration Systems
*   Using Git hooks to trigger automated builds and tests.
*   Ensuring that code is always in a working state.
