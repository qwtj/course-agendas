# Javascript SAFE API Calls #APISecurity #Javascript
This mind map outlines key concepts, strategies, and best practices for making secure API calls from JavaScript applications, covering both client-side and server-side (Node.js) perspectives.

## Foundational Concepts #Basics #Overview
Understanding the core principles and context of API calls in JavaScript.

### What are APIs? #Definition #Interface
Explanation of Application Programming Interfaces and their role in web development.

### HTTP/S Protocol Basics #Networking #Protocols
Essential HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH), status codes, headers, and the importance of HTTPS. [18]

### Client-Side vs. Server-Side API Calls #Architecture #Context
Differences in security implications when calls originate from the browser versus a Node.js backend. [6]
Client-side calls are inherently less secure as code and potentially keys are exposed. [2, 6]
Server-side calls offer better control and security. [6]

### Statelessness of REST APIs #REST #Design
Understanding how statelessness impacts security requirements, especially for authentication and authorization. [16]

## Security Fundamentals #CoreSecurity #Principles

### Principle of Least Privilege #AccessControl #Authorization
Granting only the minimum necessary permissions for an API key or user session. [16]

### Input Validation and Sanitization #DataHandling #InjectionPrevention
Crucial for preventing injection attacks (XSS, SQLi, Command Injection) by validating data types, formats, lengths, and ranges, and sanitizing user-provided input. [1, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 20, 22]
Treat all input as potentially malicious. [7]
Use libraries like express-validator for server-side validation. [1]
Validate content types expected and received. [11, 12]

### Output Encoding #XSSPrevention #DataHandling
Properly encoding data before rendering it in the DOM to prevent XSS. [1, 4]
Using template engines' built-in escaping functions. [1]

### Use HTTPS Everywhere #Encryption #TransportSecurity
Mandatory use of TLS (SSL's successor) to encrypt data in transit, preventing Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. [5, 11, 15, 18, 20]
Enforce TLS 1.2 or higher with strong cipher suites. [11, 22]
Use HSTS header to enforce HTTPS. [7, 11]

### Secrets Management #Credentials #Security
Handling API keys, tokens, and other secrets securely.

#### Avoid Hardcoding Secrets #BestPractice #Vulnerability
Never embed API keys or sensitive credentials directly in client-side JavaScript or even server-side code. [2, 6]

#### Environment Variables #Configuration #Backend
Store secrets in environment variables on the server. [6]

#### Server-Side Proxy/BFF #Architecture #FrontendSecurity
Create a backend (like a Node.js server or Backend-for-Frontend) to handle API calls to third-party services, keeping keys off the client. [6] The client calls your proxy, which then securely calls the external API.

#### API Key Rotation #Maintenance #SecurityPolicy
Regularly change API keys to limit the window of opportunity if a key is compromised. [6, 10]

## Authentication #Identity #Verification
Verifying the identity of the user or client making the API call.

### Token-Based Authentication (JWT, OAuth) #Standards #Tokens
Using tokens (like JSON Web Tokens) issued after login instead of sending credentials with each request. [1, 3, 5, 10, 11, 15, 16]
JWTs contain encoded user info and permissions, signed to prevent tampering. [3, 5]
Use standard libraries for token generation and validation (e.g., `jsonwebtoken`). [1, 3, 10]
Store tokens securely (e.g., HttpOnly, Secure cookies) not in Local Storage (vulnerable to XSS). [18]

### API Keys #ProgrammaticAccess #Credentials
Assigning unique keys for programmatic access, often used for server-to-server or third-party integrations. [2, 12, 18]
Keys should be treated like passwords. [6]
Allow different permission levels for different keys. [18]

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) #EnhancedSecurity #Verification
Adding extra layers of security beyond passwords or tokens. [1, 16]

### Secure Password Handling #Backend #Hashing
Hashing passwords securely on the server using strong algorithms (e.g., bcrypt). [1]

### Authentication Flow Security #OAuth #Login
Using secure practices like OAuth 2.0 PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) to prevent CSRF and code injection during authentication flows. [18]
Validating `redirect_uri` in OAuth flows. [11]

## Authorization #Permissions #AccessControl
Determining what an authenticated user/client is allowed to do.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) #Roles #Permissions
Assigning permissions based on user roles. [1, 5, 7, 15, 16]

### Scope-Based Access (OAuth Scopes) #Granularity #OAuth
Using scopes in OAuth to grant specific, limited permissions. [10]

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) / Fine-Grained Authorization #Policies #Context
Making access decisions based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment. Checking permissions at the API level itself. [10, 16]

### Policy Enforcement Points #Architecture #SecurityGates
Using API Gateways or dedicated authorization services (like OPA) to enforce policies centrally. [10, 16]
Implement authorization checks at each API endpoint. [12]

## Asynchronous Operations & Error Handling #Promises #AsyncAwait

### Using Promises and Async/Await #CodeStyle #Readability
Handling asynchronous nature of API calls cleanly.

### Proper Error Handling #Resilience #Debugging
Catching errors from network issues, server errors (5xx), or client errors (4xx).
Handling specific HTTP status codes appropriately. [12]
Avoiding leaking sensitive information in error messages. [5, 22]
Providing generic server error messages but specific client error details. [22]
Using correlation IDs for easier debugging. [22]

### Retry Mechanisms & Circuit Breakers #Resilience #Network
Implementing strategies to handle temporary network failures or unresponsive APIs.

## CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) #BrowserSecurity #Headers
Handling browser security mechanisms that restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts.

### Understanding CORS Policy #Mechanism #SecurityFeature
How browsers enforce same-origin policy and how CORS allows controlled exceptions.

### Server-Side Configuration #Backend #Headers
Setting appropriate CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, etc.) on the API server to allow requests from specific origins. [13]

### Preflight Requests (OPTIONS) #HTTP #CORS
Understanding the purpose of OPTIONS requests made by browsers before certain types of cross-origin requests.

## Rate Limiting and Throttling #AbusePrevention #Performance
Protecting APIs from abuse (DDoS, brute-force) and ensuring availability. [1, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 22]

### Implementing Rate Limits #ServerSide #Configuration
Setting limits on the number of requests allowed per user/IP/API key within a time window. [11, 15, 16]

### Throttling Strategies #Control #Performance
Techniques like leaky bucket or token bucket to manage request flow.

### API Gateway Integration #Infrastructure #Management
Leveraging API gateways for centralized rate limiting. [11, 15]

## Common Security Vulnerabilities & Mitigations #Threats #Defense

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) #Injection #FrontendSecurity
Preventing injection of malicious scripts via user input. Mitigated by input validation/sanitization and output encoding. [1, 4, 7, 14, 20, 21]
Using Content Security Policy (CSP). [20]
Using `HttpOnly` cookies. [18, 20]

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) #SessionRiding #StateChanging

Using anti-CSRF tokens (synchronizer token pattern). [7]
Checking Origin/Referer headers (with limitations).
Using SameSite cookie attribute.

### SQL Injection (SQLi) #Injection #BackendSecurity
Preventing manipulation of database queries via user input. Mitigated by input validation and parameterized queries/prepared statements. [1, 4, 7, 14]

### Command Injection #Injection #BackendSecurity
Preventing execution of arbitrary OS commands via user input. Mitigated by input validation and avoiding direct command concatenation. Using safer APIs like `execFile`. [8]

### Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) #Authorization #AccessControl
Ensuring users can only access objects/data they are authorized for. Requires checks at the API level. [14]

### Broken Authentication #Authentication #Vulnerability
Flaws in login mechanisms, token handling, or session management. [14]

### Excessive Data Exposure #DataLeakage #APIResponse
APIs returning more data than necessary, relying on the client to filter. Filter data server-side. [14, 5]

### Security Misconfiguration #Setup #Hardening
Incorrect server settings, default credentials, verbose errors, unnecessary features enabled. [14]
Using security headers like Helmet.js middleware. [1]

### Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks #Interception #Encryption
