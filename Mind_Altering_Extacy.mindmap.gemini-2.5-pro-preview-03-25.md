*   Purity varies significantly, impacting effects and risks. #VariablePurity

## Pharmacology #Neuroscience #MechanismOfAction #BrainEffects
How MDMA interacts with the brain and body.
### Mechanism of Action #Neurotransmitters #HowItWorks
*   Primary Action: Increases release and blocks reuptake of serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA). #Serotonin #Dopamine #Norepinephrine #NeurotransmitterRelease #ReuptakeInhibition
*   Interaction with Transporters: Affects membrane transporters (SERT, NET, DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporters (VMAT2). #Transporters #VMAT2
*   Receptor Activity: Agonist activity at serotonin receptors (e.g., 5-HT2). #Receptors #5HT2A
### Pharmacokinetics #Absorption #Metabolism #Excretion
*   Administration Routes: Primarily oral (tablets, capsules), less commonly insufflation (snorting), inhalation, injection, rectal. #Oral #Insufflation #RoutesOfAdministration
*   Onset of Effects: 30-60 minutes orally. #Onset
*   Peak Effects: 75-120 minutes orally. #PeakEffect
*   Duration of Effects: 3-6 hours typically. #Duration
*   Metabolism: Primarily in the liver via CYP450 enzymes (esp. CYP2D6). #Metabolism #Liver #CYP2D6
    *   Major Metabolites: MDA (methylenedioxyamphetamine), HMMA, HMA etc. #Metabolites #MDA
    *   MDMA can inhibit its own metabolism (CYP2D6), increasing risk with repeated dosing. #MetabolicInhibition #Risk
*   Elimination Half-Life: Approx. 6-9 hours (variable, enantiomer-dependent). #HalfLife #Excretion
