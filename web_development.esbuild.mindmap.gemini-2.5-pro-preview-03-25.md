## Key Features & Capabilities #Features #Functionality
Details the main functionalities provided by Esbuild out-of-the-box.
### Extreme Speed #Performance #Benchmark
Achieved through Go (native code), parallelism, efficient memory usage, and minimal data transformations. #Go #Parallelism #Optimization
Benchmarks often show 10-100x speed improvements over other bundlers. #Benchmarking
### Bundling #CoreFeature #Bundling
Combines multiple JavaScript (ESM, CommonJS) or CSS files into single outputs. #JavaScript #CSS #Modules
Resolves dependencies and creates a dependency graph. #DependencyResolution
### Minification #Optimization #Minification
Reduces code size by removing whitespace, shortening variable names, etc. #CodeSize #Performance
Applies to both JavaScript and CSS.
### Loaders (Content Types) #Loaders #FileTypes
Built-in support for processing various file types without plugins. #BuiltInSupport
Default loaders: JavaScript (`.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`), TypeScript (`.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`), JSX, TSX, CSS, JSON. #TypeScript #JSX #CSS #JSON
Other loaders: `text`, `binary`, `base64`, `dataurl`, `file`, `empty`. #Text #Binary #DataURL #ExternalFile
### Code Splitting #Optimization #CodeSplitting
Splits code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand. #Performance #LazyLoading
Automatic code splitting based on dynamic `import()`.
### Tree Shaking #Optimization #DeadCodeElimination
Removes unused code (dead code elimination) from the final bundle. #BundleSize #Performance
Works primarily with ES6 modules. #ESM
### Source Maps #Debugging #SourceMaps
Generates source maps to map bundled code back to the original source files for easier debugging. #Development #Troubleshooting
Options for linked, external, inline, or both.
### JSX Support #Frontend #JSX
Transforms JSX syntax (used by React, Preact, etc.) into JavaScript. #React #Preact
Typically enabled automatically via file extension (`.jsx`, `.tsx`).
### TypeScript Support #TypeScript #Transpilation
