# I. Introduction to Medical Diseases

## Understanding Basic Medical Terminology

### Root words, prefixes, and suffixes in medical language.
 *   Example: `cardio-` (heart), `-itis` (inflammation).

### Common medical abbreviations and acronyms.
 *   Examples: `BP` (blood pressure), `MRI` (magnetic resonance imaging).

## Overview of Disease Classifications

### Infectious diseases (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic).
 *   Example: Bacterial pneumonia, influenza, athlete's foot, malaria.
### Non-infectious diseases (genetic, metabolic, autoimmune, degenerative).
 *   Example: Cystic fibrosis, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease.
### Neoplastic diseases (cancers).
 *   Example: Lung cancer, leukemia, melanoma.

# II. Infectious Diseases

## Bacterial Infections

### Understanding bacterial structure and function.
 *   Gram-positive vs. Gram-negative bacteria.

### Common bacterial diseases and their causative agents.
 *   Streptococcal infections ( *Streptococcus pyogenes* ), tuberculosis ( *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* ), *E. coli* infections.

### Antibiotic mechanisms and resistance.
 *   Beta-lactam antibiotics, quinolones, mechanisms of resistance development.
### Antibiotic Stewardship
 *   Strategies for appropriate antibiotic use to prevent resistance.

## Viral Infections

### Understanding viral structure and replication.
 *   DNA vs. RNA viruses, lytic vs. lysogenic cycles.

### Common viral diseases and their causative agents.
 *   Influenza viruses, HIV, hepatitis viruses (A, B, C), SARS-CoV-2.

### Antiviral mechanisms and resistance.
 *   Neuraminidase inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
### Vaccines and their role in preventing viral infections.
 *   mRNA vaccines, inactivated vaccines, live attenuated vaccines.

## Fungal Infections

### Understanding fungal structure and growth.
 *   Yeast vs. mold.

### Common fungal diseases.
 *   Candidiasis, aspergillosis, dermatophytosis (ringworm).

### Antifungal mechanisms and resistance.
 *   Azoles, amphotericin B.

## Parasitic Infections

### Understanding parasite life cycles and transmission.
 *   Protozoa, helminths.

### Common parasitic diseases.
 *   Malaria, giardiasis, tapeworm infections.

### Antiparasitic drugs and their mechanisms.
 *   Chloroquine, metronidazole.

# III. Non-Infectious Diseases

## Genetic Diseases

### Understanding basic genetics and inheritance patterns.
 *   Autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked inheritance.

### Common genetic diseases.
 *   Cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Huntington's disease.

### Genetic testing and counseling.

## Metabolic Diseases

### Understanding basic metabolic pathways (carbohydrate, lipid, protein).
### Common metabolic diseases.
 *   Diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2), hyperlipidemia, phenylketonuria (PKU).
### Monitoring and management of metabolic diseases.
 *   Blood glucose monitoring, dietary modifications, enzyme replacement therapy.

## Autoimmune Diseases

### Understanding the immune system and autoimmunity.
 *   T cells, B cells, antibodies.

### Common autoimmune diseases.
 *   Rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis.

### Immunosuppressive therapies.
 *   Corticosteroids, methotrexate.

## Degenerative Diseases

### Understanding cellular aging and degeneration.

### Common degenerative diseases.
 *   Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, osteoarthritis.
### Symptomatic treatments and supportive care.

# IV. Neoplastic Diseases (Cancers)

## Understanding the Cell Cycle and Cancer Development

### Cell cycle checkpoints and regulation.
### Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
### Hallmarks of cancer.

## Types of Cancer

### Carcinomas, sarcomas, leukemias, lymphomas.
### Staging and grading of cancers.
 *   TNM staging system.

## Cancer Treatment Modalities

### Surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy.
### Targeted therapies.
### Side effects and management of cancer treatments.
### Palliative Care
*  Symptom management and quality of life improvement

# V. Diagnostic Methods in Medical Diseases

## Physical Examination Techniques

### Inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation.
### Importance of patient history.

## Laboratory Tests

### Blood tests (CBC, metabolic panel, liver function tests).
### Urine tests (urinalysis, urine culture).
### Microbiology cultures (blood, urine, sputum).

## Imaging Techniques

### X-rays, CT scans, MRI, ultrasound.
### Interpretation of images.

## Biopsy and Pathology

### Tissue sampling and processing.
### Microscopic examination of tissue samples.
### Immunohistochemistry.
