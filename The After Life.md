# I. Philosophical Concepts of Afterlife

## Understanding Dualism

### Defining Dualism

Distinction between mind/soul and body; exploration of substance dualism (Descartes).

*   Example: Descartes' argument that the mind is indivisible while the body is divisible.
*   Key Term: Substance Dualism: The view that mind and body are composed of different substances.

### Evaluating Dualism

Critiques of dualism: the interaction problem (how mind and body interact); physicalism as an alternative.

## Examining Materialism

### Defining Materialism

The view that only matter exists; the mind is a product of brain activity.

*   Example: Eliminative materialism, which denies the existence of mental states.
*   Key Term: Eliminative Materialism: The view that folk psychological concepts like "belief" and "desire" are ultimately false and will be replaced by neuroscientific concepts.

### Exploring Types of Materialism

Identity theory (mental states = brain states); functionalism (mental states = functional roles).

*   Example: Pain is identical to the firing of C-fibers (Identity Theory). Pain is a state caused by bodily damage and that causes distress and avoidance behavior (Functionalism).

## Analyzing Idealism

### Defining Idealism

The view that reality is fundamentally mental or immaterial.

*   Example: George Berkeley's subjective idealism, asserting "to be is to be perceived."
*   Key Term: Subjective Idealism: The belief that only minds and their perceptions exist.

### Exploring Variations of Idealism

Objective idealism (mind-independent reality is fundamentally mental); transcendental idealism (Kant).

*   Example: Hegel's objective idealism, where the Absolute Idea is the ultimate reality. Kant's transcendental idealism, positing that our experience is structured by innate categories of understanding.

## Summary: Philosophical Foundations

Overview of dualism, materialism, and idealism as competing metaphysical frameworks for understanding the nature of reality and the possibility of an afterlife.
