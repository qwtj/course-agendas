# Creative Coding #Overview #Art #Technology
Creative coding is an artistic practice that utilizes programming and computational processes as a medium for expression and creation. It emphasizes exploration, experimentation, iteration, and aesthetics over purely functional goals often found in traditional programming. It sits at the intersection of art, design, and technology.

## Introduction and Fundamentals #Basics #Philosophy #Definition
Defines creative coding, its core philosophy, and historical context.
### What is Creative Coding? #Definition #Concept
Using code as a primary medium for artistic expression rather than solely for functional problem-solving. It blends technical programming skills with artistic intent. Focuses on aesthetics, emotional impact, and interactivity.
### Philosophy and Approach #Mindset #Process
Emphasizes exploration, iteration, reflection, discovery, and experimentation. Often involves an "unintentional design" or "function follows form" approach, where the process of coding leads to unexpected outcomes.
### History and Origins #Context #Evolution
Roots in early computer art, algorithmic art, and pioneers exploring computation as an artistic tool. Influence of movements and figures in generative art and computational design. Development of early tools like Design By Numbers (DBN).
### Creative Coding vs. Traditional Programming #Distinction #Goals
Highlights the difference in intent: expression and aesthetics vs. functionality and problem-solving. Creative coding often embraces imperfection and unpredictability.
### Creative Coding vs. Generative Design #Distinction #Method
While related, generative design often aims to solve specific design problems within defined constraints, whereas creative coding can be more open-ended and explorative.
