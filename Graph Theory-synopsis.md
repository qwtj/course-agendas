Learning Objectives: Understand graph theory concepts, traversal algorithms, shortest path algorithms, minimum spanning trees, and network flow.

Prerequisites: Basic programming knowledge, data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, queues, stacks, heaps).

Depth & Scope: Intermediate; covers fundamental algorithms and concepts with code examples. Focuses on algorithmic implementation, not advanced theoretical proofs.

Target Audience: Software engineers, computer science students.

Technical Details: Python implementations of BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, sample adjacency matrix and list representations.

Relevant Technologies/Tools: Python.

Preferred Format/Length: Detailed explanations with concise code examples.
