# I. Introduction to Web Accessibility

## Understanding the Principles of Accessibility

### Perceivable

* Ensuring content is available to the senses (sight, hearing, touch).
* Example: Providing alternative text for images.
* Example: Providing captions for videos.

### Operable

* Ensuring users can interact with all controls and interactive elements.
* Example: Making website navigation usable with a keyboard.
* Example: Providing sufficient time for users to read and use the content.

### Understandable

* Ensuring content and interface are clear and easy to comprehend.
* Example: Using clear and simple language.
* Example: Providing consistent navigation.

### Robust

* Ensuring content can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
* Example: Using valid HTML and CSS.
* Example: Testing compatibility with different browsers and assistive technologies.

## Introduction to Assistive Technologies

### Screen Readers

* Software that converts text to speech.
* Example: NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver.
* Understanding how screen readers interpret web content.

### Screen Magnifiers

* Software that enlarges portions of the screen.
* Understanding how magnified content affects usability.

### Alternative Input Devices

* Devices that allow users to interact with computers in different ways.
* Example: Speech recognition software, eye-tracking devices, switch devices.

# II. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

## Understanding WCAG 2.1 and 2.2

### WCAG Structure: Principles, Guidelines, Success Criteria, and Techniques

* Understanding the relationship between the different levels.
* Understanding conformance levels (A, AA, AAA).

### Perceivable Guidelines and Success Criteria

* Guideline 1.1: Text Alternatives (e.g., alt text for images).
    * Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content (Level A).
* Guideline 1.2: Time-based Media (e.g., captions for videos).
    * Success Criterion 1.2.1: Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded) (Level A).
* Guideline 1.3: Adaptable (e.g., semantic structure).
    * Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships (Level A).
* Guideline 1.4: Distinguishable (e.g., sufficient color contrast).
    * Success Criterion 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA).

### Operable Guidelines and Success Criteria

* Guideline 2.1: Keyboard Accessible (e.g., keyboard navigation).
    * Success Criterion 2.1.1: Keyboard (Level A).
* Guideline 2.2: Enough Time (e.g., adjustable time limits).
    * Success Criterion 2.2.1: Timing Adjustable (Level A).
* Guideline 2.3: Seizures (e.g., avoid content that could cause seizures).
    * Success Criterion 2.3.1: Three Flashes or Below Threshold (Level A).
* Guideline 2.4: Navigable (e.g., clear navigation and focus order).
    * Success Criterion 2.4.4: Link Purpose (In Context) (Level A).

### Understandable Guidelines and Success Criteria

* Guideline 3.1: Readable (e.g., clear language).
    * Success Criterion 3.1.1: Language of Page (Level A).
* Guideline 3.2: Predictable (e.g., consistent navigation).
    * Success Criterion 3.2.1: On Focus (Level A).
* Guideline 3.3: Input Assistance (e.g., error identification and labels).
    * Success Criterion 3.3.1: Error Identification (Level A).

### Robust Guidelines and Success Criteria

* Guideline 4.1: Compatible (e.g., valid HTML).
    * Success Criterion 4.1.1: Parsing (Level A).
    * Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value (Level A).

## Applying WCAG Techniques

### Sufficient Techniques

* Techniques that are enough to meet a Success Criterion.
* Example: Using alt text that accurately describes an image.

### Advisory Techniques

* Techniques that are not required but can improve accessibility.
* Example: Providing transcripts for audio content, even if captions are already provided.

### Failure Techniques

* Things to avoid that can cause accessibility problems.
* Example: Using color alone to convey information.

# III. Implementing Accessibility in HTML

## Semantic HTML

### Using Semantic Elements

* `header`, `nav`, `main`, `article`, `aside`, `footer`
* Understanding the proper use of these elements.

### Creating Effective Headings

* Using `<h1>` to `<h6>` elements appropriately.
* Ensuring headings are hierarchical and describe the content that follows.

### Creating Accessible Forms

### Using Appropriate Labels

* Associating labels with form elements using the `<label>` element and the `for` attribute.

### Providing Instructions and Error Messages

* Guiding users through form completion.
* Displaying clear and helpful error messages.

### Using ARIA Attributes (if semantic HTML is insufficient)

## ARIA Roles

### Understanding ARIA Roles

* Defining the purpose of an element.
* Example: `role="button"`, `role="navigation"`.

### Using ARIA States and Properties

* Providing additional information about an element's state or properties.
* Example: `aria-expanded="true"`, `aria-label="Close"`.

## Accessible Images

### Providing Alternative Text

### Writing Effective Alt Text

* Describing the image content and function.
* Using null alt text (`alt=""`) for decorative images.

### Using Long Descriptions (if necessary)

* Providing a more detailed description using `longdesc` attribute (less supported, use with caution).
* Linking to a separate page or section with a detailed description.

# IV. Accessibility and CSS

## Ensuring Sufficient Color Contrast

### Understanding Color Contrast Ratios

* Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for standard text (WCAG AA).
* Minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 for large text (WCAG AA).
* Tools for checking color contrast (e.g., WebAIM Color Contrast Checker).

## Designing for Keyboard Navigation

### Using Focus Styles

* Ensuring focus is clearly visible on interactive elements.
* Avoiding removing the focus outline without providing an alternative.

### Maintaining Logical Focus Order

* Ensuring the tab order follows the visual layout of the page.
* Using the `tabindex` attribute carefully (generally avoid negative `tabindex`).

## Responsive Design and Accessibility

### Ensuring Accessibility on Different Devices

* Testing on various screen sizes and devices.
* Using responsive techniques to ensure content remains accessible.

# V. JavaScript and Accessibility

## Accessible JavaScript Interactions

### Managing Focus with JavaScript

* Moving focus to newly created elements.
* Trapping focus within modal dialogs.

### Creating Accessible Custom Widgets

* Ensuring custom widgets are keyboard accessible.
* Using ARIA roles, states, and properties appropriately.

### Providing Dynamic Content Updates

### Using ARIA Live Regions

* Announcing dynamic content updates to screen readers.
* Example: `aria-live="polite"`, `aria-live="assertive"`.

# VI. Testing and Auditing

## Manual Accessibility Testing

### Using a Keyboard for Navigation

* Testing all interactive elements.
* Ensuring focus is visible and logical.

### Using a Screen Reader

* Testing the page with a screen reader (e.g., NVDA, JAWS).
* Verifying the content is read in a logical order.

## Automated Accessibility Testing

### Using Accessibility Testing Tools

* Example: WAVE, Axe, Lighthouse.
* Interpreting the results of automated tests.
* Addressing identified issues.

### Validating HTML and CSS

### Using a Validator

* Ensuring the code is valid and well-formed.
* Addressing any validation errors.

## User Testing with People with Disabilities

### Conducting User Testing

* Involving users with disabilities in the testing process.
* Gathering feedback on the accessibility of the website.

# VII. Maintaining Accessibility

## Accessibility Documentation

### Creating Accessibility Statements

* Documenting the website's accessibility features.
* Providing contact information for accessibility-related issues.

## Continuous Integration and Accessibility

### Integrating Accessibility Testing into the Development Process

* Running automated tests as part of the build process.
* Addressing accessibility issues early in the development cycle.

## Staying Up-to-Date with Accessibility Standards

### Monitoring Updates to WCAG and Other Standards

* Following industry best practices.
* Continuously improving the accessibility of the website.
