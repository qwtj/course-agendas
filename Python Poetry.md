# I. Introduction to Python Poetry

## Understanding Poetry's Purpose

### Dependency Management

*   Defining project dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
*   Resolving dependency conflicts.
*   Installing and updating dependencies using `poetry install` and `poetry update`.

### Packaging and Distribution

*   Creating packages for distribution using `poetry build`.
*   Publishing packages to PyPI or other repositories using `poetry publish`.

## Installing Poetry

### Installation Methods

*   Using the official installer script.
    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
    ```
*   Using `pip` (discouraged but possible).
    ```bash
    pip install poetry
    ```

### Configuring the Environment

*   Setting up the PATH environment variable.
*   Verifying the installation using `poetry --version`.

# II. Project Setup and Configuration

## Creating a New Project

### Using the `poetry new` Command

*   Creating a basic project structure with `poetry new <project-name>`.
*   Understanding the generated files: `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `<project_name>/__init__.py`.

### Customizing Project Settings

*   Modifying the `pyproject.toml` file.
*   Setting project name, version, description, authors, license.
    ```toml
    [tool.poetry]
    name = "my-project"
    version = "0.1.0"
    description = "A brief description of my project."
    authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]
    license = "MIT"
    ```
*   Specifying Python versions.
    ```toml
    [tool.poetry.dependencies]
    python = "^3.8"
    ```

## Managing Dependencies

### Adding Dependencies

*   Using the `poetry add` command to install packages.
    ```bash
    poetry add requests
    ```
*   Specifying version constraints.
    ```bash
    poetry add requests "^2.20.0"
    poetry add flask "~1.1.0"
    poetry add numpy "==1.23.0"
    ```
*   Understanding caret (`^`), tilde (`~`), and equality (`==`) version specifiers.

### Removing Dependencies

*   Using the `poetry remove` command to uninstall packages.
    ```bash
    poetry remove requests
    ```

### Grouping Dependencies

*   Defining dependency groups (e.g., `dev`, `test`).
*   Installing dependency groups using `poetry install --with dev`.
*   Adding dependencies to specific groups.
    ```bash
    poetry add --group dev pytest
    ```
    ```toml
    [tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
    pytest = "^7.0"
    ```

# III. Working with the Virtual Environment

## Understanding Virtual Environments

### Purpose of Virtual Environments

*   Isolating project dependencies.
*   Avoiding conflicts between different projects.

### Poetry and Virtual Environments

*   Poetry manages virtual environments automatically.
*   Finding the virtual environment path using `poetry env info`.

## Managing the Environment

### Activating the Virtual Environment

*   Using `poetry shell` to activate the environment.
*   Understanding the shell prompt change.

### Running Commands within the Environment

*   Executing Python scripts using `python <script-name>.py`.
*   Running commands directly with `poetry run python <script-name>.py` if the environment is not active.
    ```bash
    poetry run python my_script.py
    ```

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment

*   Using the `exit` command (after `poetry shell`) or closing the terminal.

# IV. Building and Publishing Packages

## Building the Package

### Using the `poetry build` Command

*   Creating distribution archives in `dist/` directory.
*   Understanding the `.tar.gz` and `.whl` formats.

### Configuring Build Settings

*   Customizing build behavior in `pyproject.toml`.
*   Specifying include and exclude patterns for files.
    ```toml
    [tool.poetry.include]
    "my_package/data"
    ```

## Publishing the Package

### Configuring Credentials

*   Setting up credentials for PyPI or other repositories.
    ```bash
    poetry config pypi-token.pypi <your_pypi_token>
    ```

### Publishing to a Repository

*   Using the `poetry publish` command to upload the package.
*   Verifying the package on the repository website.

### Versioning and Release Management

*   Understanding semantic versioning (SemVer).
*   Updating the version in `pyproject.toml`.
*   Creating release tags in Git.

# V. Advanced Poetry Features

## Working with Lock Files

### Understanding `poetry.lock`

*   Purpose of the lock file: ensuring reproducible builds.
*   Committing the `poetry.lock` file to version control.

### Updating the Lock File

*   Using `poetry lock` to update the lock file based on the `pyproject.toml` dependencies.
*   Resolving conflicts in the lock file (if any).

## Plugin System

### Exploring Poetry Plugins

*   Discovering available plugins.
*   Installing plugins using `poetry plugin add`.

### Customizing Poetry with Plugins

*   Example: Using a plugin for automatic version bumping.
*   Exploring plugin-specific configuration options.

## Poetry Configuration

### Global Configuration

*   Configuring Poetry globally using `poetry config`.
*   Setting repositories, virtual environment locations, and other settings.

### Project-Specific Configuration

*   Overriding global settings in the `pyproject.toml` file.

# VI. Troubleshooting and Best Practices

## Common Issues

### Dependency Conflicts

*   Identifying dependency conflicts.
*   Resolving conflicts by adjusting version constraints.
*   Using `poetry show` to inspect installed dependencies.

### Environment Issues

*   Problems with virtual environment activation or deactivation.
*   Ensuring Poetry is correctly installed and configured.

## Best Practices

### Keeping Dependencies Up-to-Date

*   Regularly updating dependencies using `poetry update`.
*   Monitoring security vulnerabilities in dependencies.

### Writing Robust `pyproject.toml` Files

*   Clearly defining project metadata.
*   Using appropriate version constraints.

### Using Poetry in CI/CD Pipelines

*   Automating dependency installation and building.
*   Integrating Poetry into testing and deployment workflows.
