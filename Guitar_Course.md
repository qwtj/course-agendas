Minimizing finger movement.

## Basic Chord Progressions

### Understanding Chord Progressions

Sequences of chords that create musical phrases.

### Practicing Common Chord Progressions

I-IV-V progressions in different keys (e.g., G-C-D in G major).
Example: G-C-G-D.
I-V-vi-IV progressions (e.g., C-G-Am-F).

*Summary: Covered essential open chords, proper finger placement, smooth transitions, and basic chord progressions.*

# III. Rhythm and Strumming

## Understanding Time Signatures

### Basic Time Signatures

4/4 (common time), 3/4 (waltz time).
Understanding beats and measures.

### Counting Rhythms

Counting quarter notes, half notes, and whole notes.
Using a metronome.
