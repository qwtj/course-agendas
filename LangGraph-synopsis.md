Learning Objectives: Understand LangGraph's architecture, build basic and advanced graphs, integrate LangChain components, and debug/optimize performance.

Prerequisites: Basic Python programming, familiarity with LangChain concepts, and a general understanding of graph-based systems.

Depth & Scope: Intermediate; focuses on practical implementation and advanced features of LangGraph, excluding extremely complex or theoretical topics.

Target Audience: AI/ML engineers, data scientists, and developers with some experience in LangChain who want to build more complex, stateful applications.

Technical Details: Code examples for node definition, edge creation (conditional and multiple), state management, LangChain integration, and error handling. Visualization using `graphviz`.

Relevant Technologies/Tools: Python, LangChain, LangGraph, `pip`, `graphviz`, `TypedDict`.

Preferred Format/Length: Detailed explanations with concise code examples.
