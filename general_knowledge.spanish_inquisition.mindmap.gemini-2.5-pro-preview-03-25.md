# Spanish Inquisition #Overview #History
The Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition (Tribunal del Santo Oficio de la Inquisición), established in 1478 by the Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, was a judicial institution aimed at enforcing Catholic orthodoxy in their realms. It lasted until 1834. While ostensibly created to combat heresy, it also served to consolidate royal power and enforce social and religious uniformity through often brutal methods. [6, 3, 1]

## Origins and Establishment #Context #Foundation
Understanding the political, religious, and social environment leading to the Inquisition's creation.

### Precursors #MedievalInquisition #Heresy
The Medieval Inquisition, established in the 12th century by the Papacy (Pope Lucius III, Pope Gregory IX) primarily to combat heresies like Catharism (Albigensianism) in Southern France and elsewhere, served as a model. [3, 1, 6] Tribunals existed in Aragon from the 13th century. [1] Earlier persecutions, such as against Priscillian in Roman Spain, are sometimes cited as distant precedents. [1]

### Socio-Political Context #Reconquista #Spain
The late 15th century saw the near completion of the Reconquista, the centuries-long Christian campaign to retake the Iberian Peninsula from Muslim (Moorish) rule. [3, 6] The marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in 1469 united the major Spanish kingdoms, creating a desire for political and religious unity. [3, 6, 18] Spain was a multireligious society with significant Jewish and Muslim populations. [3]

### Religious Tensions #Conversos #Marranos #Antisemitism
Growing anti-Semitic sentiment and violence (e.g., pogroms of 1391) pressured many Jews to convert to Catholicism. [6, 3] These converts, known as *Conversos*, were often suspected of secretly practicing Judaism (*Crypto-Judaism*, pejoratively called *Marranos*). [6, 3, 10] Social unrest grew due to the perceived success and influence of Conversos. [10] This suspicion was a primary driver for the Inquisition's establishment. [3, 1]

### Papal Authorization and Royal Control #PapalBull #Monarchy
Pope Sixtus IV issued the papal bull *Exigit Sincerae Devotionis Affectus* on November 1, 1478, authorizing the Catholic Monarchs to establish the Inquisition and appoint inquisitors. [1, 3, 6] This gave the Spanish Crown significant control over the institution, distinct from the earlier papal-controlled Medieval Inquisition. [1, 18] Ferdinand and Isabella used the Inquisition to consolidate their power across their unified kingdoms. [3, 6, 11, 14] Attempts by the Pope to allow appeals to Rome were blocked by Ferdinand, solidifying royal authority. [1]

## Structure and Organization #Hierarchy #Administration
The bureaucratic framework of the Inquisition.

### Supreme Council (Suprema) #Centralization #Madrid
The *Consejo de la Suprema y General Inquisición* (Council of the Supreme and General Inquisition), established by 1488 and based in Madrid, served as the central governing body, overseeing all tribunals. [1, 9, 18]

### Inquisitor General #Leadership #Appointment
The head of the Suprema, appointed by the Crown but confirmed by the Pope. [9, 18, 1] This figure held immense authority over the Inquisition's operations. [6]

### Regional Tribunals #LocalCourts #Jurisdiction
A network of local tribunals operated throughout Spain (initially 14, later up to 21) and its colonies (e.g., Mexico, Peru, Sicily). [1, 3, 6, 18] These tribunals conducted the local investigations and trials. [6] Efforts to establish tribunals in Naples and Milan failed. [6]

### Officials #Roles #Functionaries
Tribunals employed various officials: [9, 18, 16, 13]
#### Inquisitors #Judges #Theologians
Typically two legally or theologically trained individuals per tribunal who acted as judges. [9, 18]
#### Calificadores #Advisors #Theology
Theological experts who assessed the orthodoxy of statements or beliefs. [9]
#### Fiscal #Prosecutor
Responsible for prosecuting the accused. [9, 13]
#### Alguacil #Constable #Arrest
Responsible for arrests, detention, and sometimes administering torture. [9, 13]
#### Notaries/Secretaries #RecordKeeping #Documentation
Responsible for meticulously recording procedures and testimonies. [9]
#### Comisarios #LocalAgents #Investigation
Often local priests assisting with information gathering in specific areas. [9]
#### Familiares #LayAssistants #Enforcement
Armed laymen (similar to medieval *crocesignati*) who assisted inquisitors, often through force, enjoying certain privileges like tax exemption and the right to bear arms. [9, 16] They also played a role in encouraging denunciations and capturing suspects. [16]

## Procedures and Trials #JudicialProcess #Methods
The steps involved from accusation to sentencing.

### Denunciation #Accusation #Secrecy
Trials often began with secret denunciations made by informants. [5, 16] Accused individuals were often unaware of who had accused them. [2]

### Edict of Grace #Confession #Penance
Upon arriving in a town, inquisitors would often issue an Edict of Grace, a period (typically 30 days) during which individuals could confess their heresies voluntarily for lighter penalties (like fines or pilgrimages). [1, 19, 2] Confessors were often required to inform on others, leading to potential corruption and false accusations. [19]

### Investigation and Arrest #Inquiry #Detention
Inquisitors investigated accusations, gathering evidence and testimonies. [2] If sufficient grounds were found, suspects were arrested and imprisoned. [3]

### Interrogation and Testimony #Questioning #Evidence
The accused were interrogated, often without legal counsel and without knowing the specific charges or accusers initially. [3, 2] The inquisitorial system involved the court actively participating in the trial process. [21]

### Torture #Coercion #Confession
Used systematically to extract confessions or information, not necessarily as punishment itself. [3, 2, 6, 4] Methods were often designed not to spill blood (forbidden by Church law), such as the *garrucha* (strappado/pulley) or *toca* (water torture). [19, 4] Its use was bureaucratized and documented. [4] While brutal, some analysis suggests it was often effective in extracting information the Inquisition sought. [4]

### Sentencing #Judgement #Penalties
Sentences ranged widely: [5, 16]
#### Abjuration #Renunciation
Formal renunciation of heretical beliefs.
#### Penance #Pilgrimage #Flogging
Acts like pilgrimages, wearing penitential garments (sanbenito), or public flogging. [2, 19]
#### Fines and Confiscation #EconomicPenalty #Funding
Monetary penalties and seizure of property, which helped finance the Inquisition's operations. [6, 10, 19, 5]
#### Imprisonment #Incarceration #LifeSentence
Varying terms of imprisonment, sometimes for life. [3]
#### Relaxation to the Secular Arm #Execution #Burning
Handing over condemned heretics (especially impenitent or relapsed ones) to secular authorities for execution, typically by burning at the stake. [19, 3, 1, 2] Those who repented at the last moment might be garroted (strangled) before burning. [7]

### Auto-da-Fé #PublicCeremony #Spectacle
"Act of faith"; elaborate public ceremonies where sentences were announced. [3, 8, 6] These were major public spectacles involving processions, sermons, oaths, and the formal handing over of condemned individuals for punishment, reinforcing the Inquisition's power and authority. [3, 8, 5] The auto-da-fé of June 30, 1680, in Madrid was particularly famous. [8]

## Targets of the Inquisition #Victims #Heresy
Groups and offences prosecuted by the Inquisition.

### Conversos (Judaizers) #CryptoJudaism #NewChristians
The primary initial target. [1, 10, 8, 19] Accused of secretly practicing Judaism after converting to Catholicism. Signs included observing Jewish holidays, dietary laws, or customs. [19]

### Moriscos (Crypto-Muslims) #Islam #Conversion
Muslims who converted to Catholicism (often forcibly after decrees in 1502), suspected of secretly practicing Islam. [1, 2] Persecution intensified under Cardinal Cisneros. [6] Expulsions occurred in the early 17th century. [2]

### Protestants #Reformation #Lutheranism
Especially targeted in the mid-16th century following the Reformation, though relatively few in number in Spain. [1, 6, 2, 3] Foreigners suspected of Protestantism were also pursued. [6]

### Erasmians and Alumbrados #Humanism #Mysticism
Followers of humanist Erasmus and mystical movements like the Alumbrados (Illuminated ones) were viewed with suspicion and sometimes prosecuted. [1, 16] Even prominent figures like St. Ignatius of Loyola were investigated. [3, 6]

### Blasphemy and Sacrilege #ReligiousOffense #Impiety
Speaking against God, saints, or the Church. [1]

### Bigamy #Marriage #SocialOrder
Considered a religious offense and prosecuted by the Inquisition. [1]

### Witchcraft and Superstition #Sorcery #FolkBeliefs
While investigated, the Spanish Inquisition was generally more skeptical and methodical regarding witchcraft compared to other parts of Europe, resulting in fewer executions for this specific charge. [1, 6]

### Forbidden Books (Censorship) #IndexLibrorumProhibitorum #IntellectualControl
Creation and enforcement of lists (Index) of forbidden books, controlling the circulation of ideas deemed heretical or dangerous. [1, 2, 15]

### Other Offences #Sodomy #Freemasonry #NonReligiousCrimes
Occasionally prosecuted offences like sodomy (seen as unnatural) and later, Freemasonry. [1, 18] Some non-religious crimes could also fall under its jurisdiction. [1] Indigenous peoples in the Americas were generally excluded from the Inquisition's jurisdiction by royal decree. [1]

## Key Figures #Leadership #Influence
Individuals who significantly shaped the Inquisition.

### Ferdinand II and Isabella I #CatholicMonarchs #Founders
Established the Inquisition in 1478 to unify Spain under Catholicism and consolidate their own power. [1, 3, 6] Issued the Alhambra Decree (1492) expelling Jews. [3, 6, 7]

### Tomás de Torquemada #InquisitorGeneral #Brutality
The first and most infamous Inquisitor General (appointed 1483). [6, 19, 3] Known for his severity, systematic use of torture, and fanaticism. [2, 6, 19] Oversaw the initial, intense phase of the Inquisition and urged the expulsion of the Jews. [3, 6] Issued foundational instructions (articles) for inquisitors in 1484. [3]

### Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros #Cardinal #Reformer #Moriscos
Successor as Inquisitor General (appointed 1507), also a prominent church reformer. [6, 2] Known for his zeal in persecuting Muslims (Moriscos) and promoting the suppression of Islam in Granada. [6, 2] Extended the Inquisition into North Africa. [2]

### Diego de Deza #InquisitorGeneral #Corruption
Inquisitor General after Torquemada, known for escalating persecution but also associated with corruption, allowing some accused to bribe their way out. [2]

### Other Officials #Kings #Popes
Popes like Sixtus IV (authorized establishment) and Innocent VIII (attempted to allow appeals). [1, 3, 6] Later monarchs like Philip II (used Inquisition against Protestants, extended its reach) and Charles II (reign saw large autos-da-fé). [2, 8, 6] Pope Paul III created the Roman Inquisition and permitted the Portuguese Inquisition. [2, 6]

## Economic and Social Impact #Consequences #Society
The broader effects of the Inquisition on Spanish society.

### Religious Uniformity #Catholicism #Homogeneity
Achieved a greater degree of outward religious conformity, eliminating or forcing underground other religious practices. [11, 3]

### Social Control and Fear #Paranoia #Denunciation
Created an atmosphere of fear, suspicion, and paranoia, discouraging dissent and encouraging denunciations among neighbors. [7, 5, 14] Weakened social trust in affected areas. [5, 12]

### Economic Consequences #Confiscation #Emigration #Poverty
Confiscation of property funded the Inquisition but also disrupted economic life. [5, 6] Expulsion and persecution of economically active groups (Jews, Conversos, Moriscos) harmed Spain's economy long-term. [11, 1] Studies suggest areas with higher Inquisition activity have lower levels of economic activity, trust, and education even today. [5, 12]

### Intellectual Climate and Censorship #Culture #Education
Stifled intellectual and scientific development through censorship (Index of Forbidden Books) and suspicion of educated classes. [1, 5, 12] Spain became somewhat isolated from intellectual currents elsewhere in Europe. [7, 5]

### Consolidation of Royal Power #Monarchy #Centralization
Strengthened the authority of the Spanish monarchy by creating a powerful institution loyal to the Crown and operating across different regional jurisdictions. [3, 1, 11, 14]

### Population Displacement #Expulsion #ForcedConversion
Mass expulsion of Jews (1492) and later Moriscos (early 17th century), and forced conversions significantly altered Spain's demographics. [1, 6, 11]

## Regional Variations and Expansion #Geography #Colonies
Differences in application across territories.

### Castile vs. Aragon #Intensity #Focus
Variations existed in the intensity and focus of Inquisition activity between different Spanish regions (e.g., Castile, Aragon, Valencia, Catalonia). [1]

### The Americas #NewWorld #IndigenousPeoples
Tribunals were established in Spanish colonies like Mexico and Peru, often noted for their harshness. [3, 6, 2] However, Indigenous populations were officially excluded from their jurisdiction, which focused on European settlers and their descendants. [1]

### Other Territories #Sicily #LowCountries #Portugal
Spread to Sicily (1517) and introduced into the Low Countries by Charles V to combat Protestantism (largely unsuccessfully). [6] A similar, separate Inquisition was established in Portugal (1536, with papal permission) targeting conversos there. [6, 3]

## Decline and Abolition #Enlightenment #End
The gradual weakening and eventual end of the institution.

### Declining Influence #17thCentury #18thCentury
Activity and influence declined gradually from the 17th century onwards, partly due to the diminishing number of overt "heretics" and falling revenues. [15, 8] Tribunals focused more on minor cases, censorship, and Portuguese conversos. [15]

### Enlightenment Criticism #IntellectualChallenge #Reform
Growing criticism from Enlightenment thinkers who viewed the Inquisition as backward, intolerant, and an obstacle to progress. [15, 1]

### Napoleonic Suppression #Interruption #JosephBonaparte
Temporarily suppressed by Joseph Bonaparte during the French occupation of Spain (1808). [6, 2, 15]

### Restorations and Final Abolition #FerdinandVII #IsabellaII
Restored by Ferdinand VII in 1814, suppressed again in 1820, restored briefly in 1823. [6, 3] Finally abolished permanently by decree on July 15, 1834, during the regency of María Cristina de Borbón for Isabella II. [1, 6, 3, 7] The last official execution was likely Cayetano Ripoll in 1826. [2] The Portuguese Inquisition ended in 1821. [6, 3]

## Legacy and Historiography #Memory #Interpretation
How the Inquisition is remembered and studied.

### The Black Legend (Leyenda Negra) #Propaganda #Exaggeration
Negative interpretations and propaganda, particularly from Protestant rivals (England, Netherlands), emphasizing the Inquisition's cruelty and intolerance, sometimes exaggerating its scale and impact. [1]

### Historical Debates #Statistics #Motivation
Ongoing scholarly debate regarding the number of victims (estimates range from 3,000-5,000 executions out of ~150,000 prosecuted over three centuries, though some older estimates were much higher), the primary motivations (religious zeal vs. political consolidation vs. economic gain), and its actual effectiveness and long-term impact. [1, 7, 8]

### Cultural Impact #Antisemitism #Xenophobia #Art
Contributed to long-lasting anti-Semitism and xenophobia in Spain. [8] Its impact is reflected in art (e.g., Goya) and literature. [18] The pervasive fear and social division left lasting scars. [7] Modern studies suggest measurable negative impacts on trust, education, and economic development in formerly high-activity areas. [5, 12]

### Modern Perception #MontyPython #Symbolism
Remains a powerful symbol of religious persecution and intolerance, famously satirized (e.g., Monty Python's "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!"). [21, 23]

### Successor Institution #CDF #Vatican
The Papal Inquisition (Roman Inquisition), founded in 1542, continued and evolved. It was reorganized and renamed the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) in 1965, still existing within the Vatican structure. [6, 2]
