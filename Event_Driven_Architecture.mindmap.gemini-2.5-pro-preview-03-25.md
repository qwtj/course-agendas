# Event Driven Architecture #EDA #Overview
Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern focusing on the production, detection, consumption, and reaction to events. [9, 20, 32] Systems communicate asynchronously through events, which represent significant occurrences or state changes. [3, 6, 20, 32] This promotes loose coupling, scalability, and real-time responsiveness. [1, 6, 22, 27, 32]

## Core Concepts #Fundamentals #Basics
Fundamental building blocks and ideas within EDA.

### Events #StateChange #Notification
Represent a significant occurrence or change in system state. [4, 6, 9, 23, 32] Events can carry detailed state information or just be identifiers/notifications. [4, 10, 23]
#### Event Structure #Payload #Metadata
Defines the data and metadata within an event (e.g., event type, timestamp, payload). [17, 20] Clear, consistent schemas are crucial. [17, 20]
#### Event Types #Classification #Meaning
Categorization of events.
##### Domain Events #BusinessLogic #Internal
Events specific to a particular business domain, signifying a business state change. [11]
##### Integration Events #CrossDomain #External
Events used for communication between different bounded contexts or systems. [11] Often used in microservices.

### Event Producers (Publishers / Emitters) #Source #Generator
Components or services that detect occurrences, generate events, and publish them. [2, 4, 10, 11, 20] Producers are decoupled from consumers; they don't know who is listening. [2, 4, 9]

### Event Consumers (Subscribers / Listeners / Sinks) #Receiver #Processor
Components or services that subscribe to and process events. [2, 4, 10, 11, 20] They react to events asynchronously. [6, 9] Consumers are decoupled from producers and other consumers. [2, 4]

### Event Channels (Brokers / Buses / Routers) #Middleware #Transport
Intermediary components responsible for receiving events from producers and delivering them to interested consumers. [2, 10, 11] They filter and route events. [4, 10] This facilitates decoupling. [5, 20]
#### Message Brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ) #Queue #PubSub
Traditional middleware supporting publish-subscribe and queueing patterns. Often delete messages after consumption by all subscribers. [5]
#### Event Streaming Platforms (e.g., Kafka, Pulsar) #Log #StreamProcessing
Platforms designed for handling high-volume, real-time event streams, often using a persistent, ordered log. [1, 2, 5] Consumers track their position (offset) in the stream. [5]

## Architectural Patterns #Design #Styles
Common structures and approaches for organizing event-driven systems. [22]

### Communication Patterns #Interaction #Flow
How components exchange events.
#### Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub) #Decoupling #Broadcast
Producers publish events to a channel without knowledge of subscribers. Multiple consumers can subscribe to the same event stream. [1, 5, 22] This is a common pattern in EDA. [6]
#### Point-to-Point #Queue #Direct
Events are sent to a specific queue and consumed by a single consumer instance (though multiple instances might compete for messages). [6]
#### Request-Reply (Async) #SynchronousSimulation #TwoQueues
Simulating synchronous communication using asynchronous events, typically involving a request queue and a response queue. [2, 6]

### Topology Patterns #Structure #Organization
Overall arrangement of producers, consumers, and channels. [11]
#### Mediator Topology (Orchestration) #Centralized #Control
A central component (mediator/orchestrator) manages and coordinates the flow of events and steps in a process. Provides better control and error handling but can become a bottleneck. [11, 16, 18]
#### Broker Topology (Choreography) #Decentralized #Collaboration
Components publish events to a broker, and other components react independently without central coordination. Highly decoupled, scalable, and resilient but can make overall workflow tracking complex. [2, 11, 16, 18]

### Data Management Patterns #State #Consistency
Patterns related to managing state and data consistency in EDA.
#### Event Sourcing #StateAsEvents #AuditTrail
Capturing all changes to an application state as a sequence of immutable events. The current state is derived by replaying these events. [1, 12, 15, 22, 23] Provides a full audit history. [12]
#### Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) #ReadWriteSplit #Optimization
Separating the models and logic for updating data (Commands) from reading data (Queries). [1, 12, 15, 22, 26] Often used with Event Sourcing, where the event store is the write model, and read models (projections) are derived for efficient querying. [12, 15, 26, 30]
#### Transactional Outbox #Reliability #Atomicity
Ensures that state changes and corresponding event publications occur atomically, typically by writing events to an "outbox" table within the same transaction as the state change. [3]
#### Saga Pattern #DistributedTransactions #Coordination
Manages data consistency across multiple services in a distributed transaction scenario using a sequence of local transactions coordinated via events (choreography) or a central coordinator (orchestration). [2] Compensating actions are used to handle failures. [1]

### Event Processing Styles #Analysis #Reaction
How events are processed once received. [11]
#### Simple Event Processing #ImmediateAction #Stateless
Consumers process events individually as they arrive, triggering immediate actions. [9, 11]
#### Complex Event Processing (CEP) #PatternDetection #Aggregation
Analyzing series of events over time windows to identify patterns, correlations, or derive higher-level insights. [2, 11]
#### Event Stream Processing (ESP) #RealTime #Transformation
Continuously processing streams of events in real-time, often involving filtering, transformation, aggregation, and enrichment as events flow through a pipeline. [2, 9, 11]

Managing distributed components, event flows, and potential failure modes can be complex. [1, 8, 25, 27, 28] Requires rethinking application design. [4, 23]
### Debugging & Troubleshooting #Tracing #Visibility
Tracking event flow across multiple decoupled services can be difficult. Requires robust observability. [8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 20, 25, 27]
### Testing #DistributedTesting #IntegrationTesting
Testing end-to-end flows in a distributed, asynchronous system is challenging. [11, 25, 28]
### Eventual Consistency #DataLag #Reconciliation
Managing data consistency across services that update asynchronously can be complex; requires accepting or managing eventual consistency. [12, 14, 20]
### Ordering & Exactly-Once Processing #Guarantees #Idempotency
Ensuring strict event order or exactly-once processing across distributed consumers is inherently difficult and often requires complex consumer logic (idempotency). [1, 2, 14, 25]
