# Software Design Patterns and Practices #Overview #SoftwareEngineering #BestPractices
An outline covering the fundamental concepts, types, principles, and applications of software design patterns and related best practices in software development.

## Introduction to Design Patterns #Fundamentals #Concepts #WhyPatterns
Understanding the core idea behind design patterns and their importance in software engineering.
### What are Design Patterns? #Definition #ProblemSolving
Reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems within a given context in software design. They represent established best practices.
### History and Origins (GoF) #GangOfFour #Origins #CSHistory
Brief overview of the "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" book and its impact.
### Benefits of Using Patterns #Advantages #CodeQuality #Maintainability
Improved code readability, maintainability, reusability, communication among developers, and faster development cycles.
### Drawbacks and Misuse #Criticism #AntiPatterns #OverEngineering
Potential downsides like unnecessary complexity, performance overhead, or applying patterns inappropriately.

## Foundational Design Principles #CorePrinciples #SOLID #SoftwareDesign
Underlying guidelines that inform good object-oriented design and support the effective use of patterns.
### SOLID Principles #OOP #ObjectOrientedDesign #BestPractices
A mnemonic acronym for five key design principles.
#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) #SRP #Modularity #Cohesion
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP) #OCP #Extensibility #Inheritance #Polymorphism
Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) #LSP #Inheritance #Polymorphism #Contracts
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) #ISP #Interfaces #API #Decoupling
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Prefer smaller, specific interfaces over large, general ones.
#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) #DIP #Decoupling #Abstraction #IoC
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
### Other Key Principles #DesignPhilosophy #Simplicity #CodeQuality
#### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) #DRY #CodeDuplication #Efficiency
Avoid repeating code; aim for abstraction or reuse.
#### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) #KISS #Simplicity #Clarity
Favor simple solutions over complex ones whenever possible.
#### YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) #YAGNI #Lean #Minimalism #Agile
Avoid adding functionality until it is necessary.
#### Composition over Inheritance #Composition #Inheritance #Flexibility #OOP
Favor composing objects over extending classes through inheritance for greater flexibility.
#### Law of Demeter (Principle of Least Knowledge) #LoD #Coupling #Encapsulation
A module should have limited knowledge about other modules: only interact with closely related "friends".

## Creational Patterns #ObjectCreation #Instantiation #Flexibility
Patterns concerned with the process of object creation, increasing flexibility in *how* objects are created.
### Factory Method #FactoryMethod #Instantiation #Decoupling
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
### Abstract Factory #AbstractFactory #ObjectFamilies #Decoupling
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
### Builder #Builder #ComplexObjects #StepByStepConstruction
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
### Prototype #Prototype #Cloning #Performance
Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
### Singleton #Singleton #SingleInstance #GlobalAccess
Ensure a class only has one instance and provide a global point of access to it. Often debated, use with caution.

## Structural Patterns #ObjectComposition #Relationships #Structure
Patterns concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
### Adapter #Adapter #Wrapper #Integration #Compatibility
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
### Bridge #Bridge #Decoupling #Abstraction #Implementation
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
### Composite #Composite #TreeStructure #Uniformity #Recursion
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
### Decorator #Decorator #Wrapper #DynamicBehavior #RuntimeExtension
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
### Facade #Facade #Simplicity #API #SubsystemInterface
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
### Flyweight #Flyweight #MemoryOptimization #Sharing #Performance
Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently by sharing common state between them.
### Proxy #Proxy #AccessControl #LazyLoading #Surrogate
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it, manage its lifecycle, or add functionality.

## Behavioral Patterns #ObjectInteraction #Communication #Responsibility
Patterns concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects, focusing on communication patterns.
### Chain of Responsibility #ChainOfResponsibility #Decoupling #RequestHandling
Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
### Command #Command #Encapsulation #Request #Undo #Logging
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
### Interpreter #Interpreter #Language #Parsing #DSL
Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.
### Iterator #Iterator #Traversal #Collections #Iteration
Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
### Mediator #Mediator #Decoupling #CommunicationHub #Interaction
Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.
### Memento #Memento #StateManagement #Undo #Snapshot
Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
### Observer #Observer #PublishSubscribe #EventHandling #Decoupling
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
### State #State #FiniteStateMachine #BehaviorChange #Polymorphism
Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
### Strategy #Strategy #Algorithm #Flexibility #Polymorphism
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
### Template Method #TemplateMethod #AlgorithmSkeleton #Inheritance #Customization
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
### Visitor #Visitor #Operations #SeparationOfConcerns #Extensibility
Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

## Architectural Patterns #SystemDesign #HighLevelStructure #Architecture

### Layered Architecture #Layered #N-Tier #SeparationOfConcerns
Organizes system into layers (e.g., Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access), each with specific responsibilities.
### Client-Server #ClientServer #DistributedSystems #Networking
Separates system into clients requesting services and servers providing them.
### Model-View-Controller (MVC) #MVC #UI #WebDevelopment #SeparationOfConcerns
Separates application logic into three interconnected components: Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (input handling).
### Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) #MVVM #UI #DataBinding #WPF #Xamarin
Similar to MVC, enhances separation, often used in UI frameworks with data binding support.
### Model-View-Presenter (MVP) #MVP #UI #Testing #SeparationOfConcerns
Variation of MVC where the Presenter handles UI logic, mediating between Model and View.
### Microservices Architecture #Microservices #DistributedSystems #Scalability #IndependenDeployability
Structures an application as a collection of small, autonomous services, modeled around a business domain.
### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) #SOA #WebServices #Integration #DistributedSystems
Architectural style focused on loosely coupled, interoperable services, often using web service standards.
### Event-Driven Architecture #EventDriven #Asynchronous #Decoupling #Scalability
System components react to events as they occur, promoting loose coupling and scalability.
### Pipe and Filter #PipeFilter #DataProcessing #SequentialProcessing
Processes a stream of data, where each processing step (filter) is connected to the next via a pipe.
### Blackboard Pattern #Blackboard #AI #ProblemSolving #SharedKnowledge
A central data store (blackboard) is used by multiple specialist knowledge sources to cooperatively solve a problem.
