# Diatonic Arpeggios & Modes #MusicTheory #Harmony #Improvisation
This mind map outlines the core concepts, relationships, and applications of diatonic modes and arpeggios, primarily derived from the major scale.

## Foundational Concepts #Basics #Prerequisites
Essential music theory knowledge required before diving into modes and arpeggios.

### Intervals #Theory #BuildingBlocks
Understanding the distance between two notes (e.g., Major 3rd, Perfect 5th, Minor 7th). Crucial for building scales, chords, and arpeggios.

### Scales #Fundamentals #Collections
Ordered sequences of notes defining a key or mode.
#### Major Scale #Ionian #Reference
The primary reference scale (W-W-H-W-W-W-H structure). Used as the basis for deriving diatonic modes, chords, and arpeggios.
#### Chromatic Scale #AllNotes #Reference
The scale containing all 12 pitches within an octave, separated by half steps. Used for understanding alterations and non-diatonic tones.
#### Minor Scales #Aeolian #Variations
Understanding Natural Minor (Aeolian mode), Harmonic Minor, and Melodic Minor scales provides context for other modal colors and chord qualities.

### Chords #Harmony #Vertical
Combinations of three or more notes played simultaneously.
#### Triads #BasicChords #ThreeNotes
Basic 3-note chords (Root, 3rd, 5th). Major, Minor, Diminished, Augmented qualities.
#### Seventh Chords #FourNotes #ExtendedHarmony
4-note chords adding a 7th above the root (e.g., Major 7, Minor 7, Dominant 7, Half-Diminished).

## Diatonic Scales & Tonality #Key #Framework
The system of organizing pitches around a central tonic note within a specific scale.

### The Major Scale #ParentScale #IonianMode
The foundation for Western diatonic harmony. All seven modes can be derived from it. Its structure is W-W-H-W-W-W-H.

### Scale Degrees #Functions #Numbers
Assigning numbers (1-7) to each note of the scale relative to the tonic (e.g., Tonic, Supertonic, Mediant, Subdominant, Dominant, Submediant, Leading Tone).

### Key Signatures #Notation #Keys
Sharps or flats indicating the key and the specific major scale being used.

## Diatonic Modes #Scales #Colors
Scales derived from each degree of a parent scale (typically the Major Scale). Each mode has a unique character or 'color'.

### Defining Modes #Concept #Derivation
Modes are created by starting the major scale pattern on different scale degrees, making that degree the new 'tonic' or center.

### The Seven Modes (from Major Scale) #ModalSystem #Types
#### Ionian #Mode1 #MajorScale
Identical to the Major scale (W-W-H-W-W-W-H). Associated with the I chord (Maj7).
#### Dorian #Mode2 #MinorSound #Raised6th
Minor quality (W-H-W-W-W-H-W). Like natural minor but with a raised 6th. Associated with the ii chord (m7). Often used in jazz and folk.
#### Phrygian #Mode3 #MinorSound #Flat2nd
Minor quality (H-W-W-W-H-W-W). Like natural minor but with a lowered 2nd. Creates a Spanish/Exotic sound. Associated with the iii chord (m7).
#### Lydian #Mode4 #MajorSound #Sharp4th
Major quality (W-W-W-H-W-W-H). Like major but with a raised 4th. Creates a bright, dreamy sound. Associated with the IV chord (Maj7).
#### Mixolydian #Mode5 #DominantSound #Flat7th
Major quality (W-W-H-W-W-H-W). Like major but with a lowered 7th. Creates the Dominant sound. Associated with the V chord (Dom7). Essential in blues and rock.
#### Aeolian #Mode6 #NaturalMinor
Identical to the Natural Minor scale (W-H-W-W-H-W-W). Associated with the vi chord (m7).
#### Locrian #Mode7 #DiminishedSound #Unstable
Diminished quality (H-W-W-H-W-W-W). Contains a tritone between root and 5th. Often avoided or used carefully due to instability. Associated with the vii chord (m7b5).

### Modal Characteristics #Sound #ColorNotes
Identifying the unique interval(s) in each mode compared to the parallel major or natural minor scale (e.g., Dorian's major 6th, Phrygian's minor 2nd, Lydian's augmented 4th, Mixolydian's minor 7th).

### Relative vs. Parallel Modes #Perspective #Relationship
Understanding modes as starting on different degrees of the *same* major scale (relative, e.g., C Ionian, D Dorian, E Phrygian are relative modes) versus modes starting on the *same* tonic but with different interval structures (parallel, e.g., C Ionian, C Dorian, C Phrygian).

## Diatonic Chords #Harmony #ScaleChords
Chords built using only the notes available within a specific diatonic scale (usually the Major scale).

### Building Diatonic Triads #StackingThirds #ChordQuality
Creating 3-note chords on each scale degree by stacking diatonic thirds (e.g., C Major Scale: Cmaj, Dmin, Emin, Fmaj, Gmaj, Amin, Bdim).
#### Chord Qualities per Scale Degree (Major Scale): I (Maj), ii (min), iii (min), IV (Maj), V (Maj), vi (min), vii° (dim).

### Building Diatonic Seventh Chords #ExtendedHarmony #FourNoteChords
Creating 4-note chords on each scale degree by adding another diatonic third (e.g., C Major Scale: CMaj7, Dm7, Em7, FMaj7, G7, Am7, Bm7b5).
#### Chord Qualities per Scale Degree (Major Scale): Imaj7, iim7, iiim7, IVmaj7, V7, vim7, viim7(b5).

### Harmonic Function #Tension #Resolution
How diatonic chords relate to the tonic and create movement.
#### Tonic Function (I, iii, vi) #Stability #Home
Chords providing stability and resolution.
#### Subdominant Function (IV, ii) #Movement #PreDominant
Chords creating moderate tension, often leading to the dominant.
#### Dominant Function (V, vii°) #Tension #Leading
Chords creating strong tension, strongly pulling towards the tonic.

## Diatonic Arpeggios #Melody #ChordNotes
Playing the notes of a diatonic chord sequentially rather than simultaneously. Arpeggios outline the underlying harmony.

### Defining Arpeggios #Sequential #ChordOutline
The notes of a chord played one after another (ascending or descending). Arpeggios share the same notes as their corresponding chord.

### Deriving Diatonic Arpeggios #FromChords #ScaleDegrees
Each diatonic chord corresponds to a diatonic arpeggio.
#### Triad Arpeggios (Major Scale): I (Maj), ii (min), iii (min), IV (Maj), V (Maj), vi (min), vii° (dim).
#### Seventh Arpeggios (Major Scale): Imaj7, iim7, iiim7, IVmaj7, V7, vim7, viim7(b5).

### Arpeggio Structure #Intervals #Shapes
Understanding the intervals within each arpeggio type (e.g., Maj7: R-3-5-7; m7: R-b3-5-b7; Dom7: R-3-5-b7; m7b5: R-b3-b5-b7).

### Connecting Arpeggios to Scales/Modes #Relationship #Integration
Recognizing that diatonic arpeggios are subsets of their corresponding diatonic scales/modes. The notes of the Dm7 arpeggio (D-F-A-C) are found within the D Dorian mode (D-E-F-G-A-B-C).

## Relationship: Modes, Chords & Arpeggios #Interconnection #HarmonyMelody
Understanding how these three concepts are deeply linked within a diatonic key.

### Scale -> Mode -> Chord -> Arpeggio #DerivationChain #Unity
The major scale generates 7 modes. Each mode's scale degrees generate a diatonic chord. The notes of that chord, played sequentially, form the diatonic arpeggio.

### Chord-Scale Theory #JazzHarmony #Application
The concept of matching specific scales/modes to specific chords to guide improvisation and composition. Each diatonic chord strongly implies its corresponding mode.

### Harmonic Hierarchy #Improvisation #NoteChoice
Prioritizing notes during improvisation: Chord Tones (arpeggio notes, esp. 3rd & 7th) are strongest, followed by other notes from the appropriate mode/scale.

## Melodic Application & Improvisation #Soloing #Creativity
Using modes and arpeggios to create melodies and solos over chord progressions.

### Targeting Chord Tones #StrongNotes #OutlineHarmony
Using arpeggio notes (especially the 3rd and 7th) on strong beats or at chord changes to clearly outline the harmony.

### Using Characteristic Mode Notes #ModalColor #Sound
Emphasizing the unique 'color' notes of a mode to evoke its specific sound (e.g., the major 6th in Dorian, the b2 in Phrygian).

### Connecting Arpeggios and Scales #Fluidity #Lines
Smoothly transitioning between playing arpeggios and scale fragments within the corresponding mode. Combining arpeggios from adjacent diatonic chords can outline the entire mode.

### Modal Improvisation #StaticHarmony #Vamps
Improvising using a single mode over a static chord or vamp (e.g., soloing with D Dorian over a Dm7 chord).

### Functional Improvisation (Chord-Scale) #Changes #JazzApproach
Changing modes/scales/arpeggios as the chords change in a progression (e.g., using D Dorian over Dm7, G Mixolydian over G7, C Ionian over CMaj7 in a ii-V-I progression).

### Visualization (e.g., Fretboard/Keyboard) #Patterns #InstrumentSpecific
Learning fingerings and patterns for modes and arpeggios across the instrument neck/keyboard. Recognizing shapes and connections.

## Practice Strategies #Learning #Technique
Methods for internalizing and applying modes and arpeggios.

### Scale/Mode Practice #Patterns #Fluency
Playing modes in various sequences (ascending, descending, in 3rds, 4ths, etc.) across the instrument's range. Practicing in all keys.

### Arpeggio Practice #ChordOutlines #Technique
Practicing individual arpeggio shapes (triads, 7ths). Playing diatonic arpeggios sequentially up and down a scale position. Connecting arpeggio shapes across the instrument.

### Playing Over Backing Tracks #Application #Context
Applying modes and arpeggios in a musical context over chord progressions or modal vamps.

### Ear Training #AuralSkills #Recognition
Learning to identify the sound of different modes and arpeggio qualities by ear. Singing modes and arpeggios.

### Transcription & Analysis #LearningFromMusic #Study
Analyzing solos and melodies to see how experienced musicians use modes and arpeggios. Transcribing lines to learn vocabulary.

## Beyond the Major Scale #Advanced #Exploration
Modes and arpeggios derived from other parent scales.

### Melodic Minor Harmony #JazzMinor #AlteredSounds
Modes, chords, and arpeggios derived from the Melodic Minor scale (e.g., Lydian Dominant, Altered Scale/Super Locrian).

### Harmonic Minor Harmony #Exotic #ClassicalSound
Modes, chords, and arpeggios derived from the Harmonic Minor scale (e.g., Phrygian Dominant).

## Advanced Concepts #FurtherStudy #Complexity

### Modal Interchange #BorrowedChords #Color
Temporarily borrowing chords/modes from a parallel key (e.g., using EbMaj7 (from C minor) in a C major progression).

### Superimposition #ImplyingHarmony #OutsidePlaying
Playing arpeggios or modes that imply a different harmony over the existing chord (e.g., playing a Bm7b5 arpeggio over G7 to imply G7b9#5).

### Triad Pairs #ModernSound #Hexatonics
Combining arpeggios/triads from two different diatonic chords (often a step apart) to create unique melodic lines and hexatonic sounds (e.g., Cmaj and Dm triads over Cmaj7).
