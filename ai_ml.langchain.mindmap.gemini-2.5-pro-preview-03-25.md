# LangChain #Framework #LLM #AI
LangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides tools, components, and interfaces to build context-aware, reasoning applications by connecting LLMs to other data sources and allowing them to interact with their environment. LangChain is available in Python and JavaScript/TypeScript.
