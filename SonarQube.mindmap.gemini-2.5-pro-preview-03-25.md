# SonarQube #CodeQuality #StaticAnalysis #Overview
SonarQube is an open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities across multiple programming languages. [6, 18, 24, 31, 39, 48] It aims to improve code maintainability, reliability, and security. [1, 31]

## Core Concepts and Terminology #Basics #Definitions #Fundamentals
Key ideas and vocabulary used within the SonarQube ecosystem.
### Code Quality Dimensions #Metrics #QualityModel #SevenAxes
SonarQube assesses code quality across several axes, historically referred to as the Seven Axes of Quality, though terminology may evolve (e.g., Clean Code attributes). [48] Core dimensions include:
#### Reliability (Bugs) #Bugs #Errors #Correctness
Code defects that could lead to runtime errors or incorrect behavior. [1, 3, 46]
#### Security (Vulnerabilities) #Security #SAST #Vulnerabilities
Code patterns that could be exploited by attackers (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting). [1, 3, 5, 11, 46]
#### Security Review (Security Hotspots) #Security #Review #ManualCheck
Security-sensitive code areas highlighted for manual review to determine if a vulnerability exists. [1, 18, 47]
#### Maintainability (Code Smells) #CodeSmells #Maintainability #TechnicalDebt
Code characteristics that make software hard to understand, modify, or extend (e.g., high complexity, duplication). [1, 3, 18, 46]
#### Test Coverage #Testing #UnitTests #Coverage
The percentage of code lines exercised by automated tests. [4, 5, 10, 30]
#### Duplications #Duplication #DRY #Maintainability
Sections of identical or very similar code repeated in the codebase. [4, 31]
#### Complexity #Complexity #Maintainability #Understandability
Measures of how complex the code logic is (e.g., Cyclomatic Complexity). [4, 44, 48]
#### Size #Metrics #LOC #Size
Quantifiable measures like lines of code, number of files, classes, etc.
### Issues #Issues #Findings #Defects
Specific points in the code identified as deviating from coding standards or potentially causing problems. Issues are categorized by type (Bug, Vulnerability, Code Smell). [46, 47]
#### Issue Severity #Severity #Priority #Impact
Classification of an issue's potential impact (Blocker, Critical, Major, Minor, Info). [46]
#### Issue Status #Workflow #Lifecycle #Resolution
The state of an issue during its lifecycle (Open, Confirmed, Resolved, Closed). [46]
#### Issue Assignment #Workflow #Ownership #Responsibility
Assigning responsibility for resolving an issue to a specific developer. [46]
#### Issue Flows #Analysis #Debugging #Path
Ordered secondary locations showing the execution path leading to an issue (e.g., for null pointer exceptions). [46]
### Rules #Rules #CodingStandards #Checks
Coding standards or practices checked during analysis. Violations result in issues. [3, 9, 47]
### Quality Profiles #Configuration #Rulesets #Standards
Sets of active rules used during code analysis for a specific language or project. Can be customized from default profiles (e.g., "Sonar way"). [28, 39, 42, 47]
### Quality Gates #QualityAssurance #Criteria #GoNoGo
Conditions defined on project measures (e.g., Coverage < 80%, Blocker Issues > 0) that must be met for the code to be considered acceptable for release or merge. They provide a go/no-go signal. [1, 10, 15, 36, 47]
### Metrics & Measures #Metrics #Measurement #KPIs
Quantitative values calculated during analysis (e.g., code coverage percentage, number of issues, technical debt ratio). [1, 4, 18, 47]
### Technical Debt #TechnicalDebt #Maintainability #Cost
The implied cost of rework caused by choosing an easy but limited solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. SonarQube often quantifies this in terms of remediation time. [3, 4, 31, 47]
### New Code Definition #CleanAsYouCode #Baseline #Delta
Configuration defining what constitutes "new" code for analysis focus (e.g., code changed since the previous version, in the last 30 days, or in a specific branch/pull request). Essential for the "Clean as You Code" philosophy. [7, 13, 28, 47]
### Clean as You Code #Philosophy #BestPractice #Workflow
SonarQube's recommended approach: focus on ensuring that *new* code added or changed meets the quality standards defined by the Quality Gate, rather than trying to fix all legacy issues at once. [46, 47]
### Analysis Report #Analysis #Results #Report
