## D. CSP's Role in a Secure Development Lifecycle
"<llm_prompt> Position CSP as one important tool within a secure development lifecycle, which also includes secure coding practices, vulnerability scanning, input validation, output encoding, dependency management, and regular security audits."

> **Key Takeaway:** CSP is a powerful client-side security mechanism against content injection, but it must be used as part of a comprehensive security strategy, not as a standalone solution.

*   **Glossary Terms:**
    *   "<llm_prompt> Define: Defense-in-Depth, HSTS (HTTP Strict-Transport-Security), `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, MIME-Sniffing."

*   **Section Summary:**
    *   "<llm_prompt> Summarize Section VIII: CSP is a vital part of a defense-in-depth strategy, complementing other security headers like HSTS and `X-Content-Type-Options`. It replaces `X-Frame-Options` via `frame-ancestors`. CSP has limitations and should be integrated within a broader secure development lifecycle."

*   **Self-Assessment Quiz:**
    *   "<llm_prompt> Generate 3 questions testing the concept of defense-in-depth, how CSP relates to HSTS, and the role of `frame-ancestors` vs. `X-Frame-Options`."

*   **Final Reflective Prompt:**
    *   "<llm_prompt> Ask the learner: Now that you understand CSP, how has your perspective changed on the complexity of securing modern web applications against client-side attacks?"

*   **Further Exploration Links:**
    *   "<llm_prompt> Find and provide links to the official CSP Level 3 W3C specification, the OWASP page on CSP, and Google's web.dev resources on CSP."
