## Comparing CDK with other IaC tools #Alternatives #Tradeoffs #Context
Understanding how CDK fits into the broader IaC landscape.
### CDK vs. Native CloudFormation (YAML/JSON) #Abstraction #Verbosity
Pros: Familiar languages, abstraction, less code. Cons: Requires runtime, synthesis step.
### CDK vs. AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) #ServerlessFocus #Simplicity
SAM is focused on simplifying serverless definitions; CDK is broader but can define serverless apps effectively. SAM templates can be simpler for pure serverless use cases.
### CDK vs. Terraform #MultiCloud #StateManagement
Terraform is cloud-agnostic, manages state explicitly. CDK is AWS-focused (though CDKTF exists), state managed implicitly by CloudFormation. CDK offers deeper language integration.
### CDK vs. Pulumi #MultiCloud #Polyglot #StateManagement
Pulumi is also polyglot and multi-cloud, manages its own state. Shares similarities in using imperative languages but differs in state handling and provider model.
### Choosing the Right Tool #UseCase #TeamSkills #Ecosystem
Factors influencing the choice of IaC tool based on project needs and team expertise.
