# XV. Limitations and Considerations

### Learning Objectives:
"Starting with heading level 3, state the objective: understanding the inherent limitations, constraints, and important factors to consider when implementing and using Amazon Macie."

## Focus on Amazon S3
"Starting with heading level 2, highlight that Macie's primary focus is discovering sensitive data within Amazon S3 general-purpose buckets. Mention that it does not natively scan other AWS data stores like Amazon RDS databases, DynamoDB tables, or EBS volumes directly (though data could be temporarily moved to S3 for scanning). Reference: [1], [3], [4], [6], [9]"

## Performance Impact of Full Scans
"Starting with heading level 2, discuss the potential performance and cost implications of running full, deep scans on very large S3 buckets or objects. Reiterate the trade-offs compared to sampling. Reference: [1], [3]"

## Potential for False Positives/Negatives
"Starting with heading level 2, acknowledge that automated sensitive data detection, while powerful, is not infallible. Explain the possibility of false positives (identifying non-sensitive data as sensitive) and false negatives (missing actual sensitive data). Emphasize the importance of tuning (using allow lists, custom identifiers) and validation. Reference: [1], [12]"

## Data Residency Considerations (Revisited)
"Starting with heading level 2, remind the user that Macie operates regionally, processing data within the AWS Region where it's enabled. This is generally a positive for data residency compliance but requires enabling the service in each relevant region. Reference: [1], [2]"

## Job Quotas and Service Limits
"Starting with heading level 2, mention that AWS imposes service quotas (limits) on Macie resources, such as the number of concurrent jobs, custom data identifiers, or allow list entries per account/region. Advise checking the AWS documentation for current limits. Reference: [1] [Link to AWS Service Quotas Page Placeholder]"

## KMS Encryption Compatibility
"Starting with heading level 2, note that Macie can only scan S3 objects that are unencrypted or encrypted with keys that Macie has permission to use (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS where Macie's role has decrypt permissions). Objects encrypted with client-side encryption or KMS keys Macie cannot access cannot be scanned. Reference: [Check AWS Docs for specifics]"

### Section Summary:
"Starting with heading level 3, summarize the key limitations and considerations: S3 focus, performance/cost of full scans, potential inaccuracies (false positives/negatives), regional operation, service quotas, and encryption compatibility requirements."

### Final Reflective Prompt:
"Starting with heading level 3, ask the learner to consider which limitation might be most significant in their potential use of Macie and how they might mitigate it."
