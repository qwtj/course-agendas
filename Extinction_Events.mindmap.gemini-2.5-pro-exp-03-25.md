# Extinction Events #Overview #Paleontology #Evolution
The study of events in Earth's history characterized by the widespread and rapid decrease in the planet's biodiversity.

## Defining Extinction #Definition #Concept #Biology
Understanding the different scales and types of extinction.

### Species Extinction #MicroExtinction #SingleSpecies
The cessation of existence of a species or group of taxa.

### Mass Extinction #MacroExtinction #BiodiversityLoss
A statistically significant increase above background extinction rate, resulting in widespread and rapid loss of biodiversity across different phyla and habitats.
Criteria often include loss of >75% of species in a geologically short interval.

### Background Extinction #NormalExtinction #Evolution
The ongoing, low-level extinction of species that has occurred throughout much of Earth's history.

### Functional Extinction #Ecology #Conservation
A species persists, but its population is too small or dispersed to play a significant role in its ecosystem or maintain long-term viability.

### Extinction Debt #Ecology #LagEffect #Conservation
The concept that species are inevitably doomed to extinction due to past events (like habitat loss) even if conditions improve, representing a future ecological cost.

### Lazarus Taxa #FossilRecord #Paleontology
Species thought to be extinct that reappear later in the fossil record or are rediscovered alive.

### Elvis Taxa #FossilRecord #ConvergentEvolution
Species that converge morphologically on extinct taxa, mimicking them but not being true descendants.

## Measuring Extinction #Methodology #Paleontology #Data
Techniques and evidence used to identify and quantify extinction events.

### Fossil Record #Evidence #Geology #Paleontology
Primary source of data, providing direct evidence of past life and its disappearance.

### Stratigraphy #Geology #Dating #Correlation
Using rock layers (strata) to establish the relative timing of extinctions and associated environmental changes.

### Biostratigraphy #Fossils #Correlation #Dating
Using the fossil content of rocks to correlate strata and define geological time periods and extinction boundaries.

### Geochronology #Dating #RadiometricDating #Isotopes
Absolute dating methods (e.g., Uranium-Lead, Argon-Argon) used to determine the precise age of rock layers bracketing extinction events.

### Extinction Rates #Metrics #Quantification #Biodiversity
Calculating the number of species or higher taxa disappearing per unit time (e.g., extinctions per million species-years, E/MSY). Comparing event rates to background rates.

### Challenges and Biases #Limitations #FossilRecord #Interpretation
Issues affecting the interpretation of the fossil record.
*   #### Signor-Lipps Effect #Artifact #FossilRecord
    The observation that the last fossil appearance of a species often predates its actual extinction time due to incomplete preservation/sampling.
