# I. Introduction to NVIDIA Cosmos

## Understanding the Purpose of NVIDIA Cosmos

### Defining Cosmos

Cosmos is NVIDIA's composable simulation platform aimed at creating photorealistic, physically accurate virtual worlds. It simplifies the integration of diverse simulation technologies.
*   **Glossary**:

    *   **Photorealistic**: Visuals that are highly realistic, resembling real-world scenes and objects.

### Key Features and Benefits

*   **Modularity**: Enabling users to choose and integrate specific simulation components as needed.
*   **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale simulations and datasets.
*   **Physically-Based Rendering (PBR)**: Achieving realistic visuals by accurately simulating the behavior of light.

## Cosmos Workflow Overview

### Data Ingestion

*   Importing data from various 3D content creation tools (e.g., Maya, Blender, 3ds Max). Supported formats such as USD, glTF, etc.
*   Preparing assets for simulation.

### Simulation Setup

*   Interactive visualization of simulation results.

## Understanding USD (Universal Scene Description)

### Basics of USD

USD is an open-source, extensible system for scene description and interchange developed by Pixar. Cosmos relies heavily on USD for managing and organizing scene data.

### Key Concepts in USD

*   **Schemas**: Definitions for the types of data that can be stored in a USD file.
*   **Layers**: Overlays that allow non-destructive editing and composition of scenes.
*   **Variants**: Mechanisms for managing alternative representations of scene elements.

### Practical Task: Examining a Sample USD File

```python
# Example of a simple USD structure
def create_usd_stage():
    from pxr import Usd, UsdGeom
    stage = Usd.Stage.CreateNew("simple_scene.usda")
    default_prim = UsdGeom.Xform.Define(stage, "/World").GetPrim()
    stage.SetDefaultPrim(default_prim)
    sphere = UsdGeom.Sphere.Define(stage, "/World/Sphere")
    sphere.GetRadiusAttr().Set(2.0)
    stage.Save()
```

*Save the above script as a `.py` file and execute it. Open "simple\_scene.usda" in a text editor to observe the USD structure.*
