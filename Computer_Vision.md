# I. Image Fundamentals

## Understanding Image Representation

### Pixels, Resolution, and Aspect Ratio
*   Definition of a pixel and its role in image formation.
*   Image resolution (e.g., 640x480, 1920x1080) and its impact on image quality.
*   Aspect ratio (e.g., 4:3, 16:9) and its implications.

### Color Spaces: RGB, Grayscale, HSV, CMYK
*   RGB (Red, Green, Blue): Additive color model for display.
    *   Representation of colors as a combination of red, green, and blue intensities.
    *   Example: Pure red = (255, 0, 0).
*   Grayscale: Single-channel representation of brightness.
    *   Conversion from RGB to grayscale using weighted averages (e.g., `0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B`).
*   HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value): Intuitive color model for human perception.
    *   Hue: Color type (e.g., red, blue, green).
    *   Saturation: Color intensity.
    *   Value: Brightness.
*   CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black): Subtractive color model for printing.

## Image File Formats

### Common Formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF
*   JPEG: Lossy compression, suitable for photographs.
    *   Compression artifacts and their impact on image quality.
*   PNG: Lossless compression, suitable for images with sharp lines and text.
    *   Alpha channel support for transparency.
*   GIF: Limited color palette (256 colors), suitable for simple animations.
*   TIFF: Lossless format, commonly used for archival purposes.

### Understanding Compression Techniques

# II. Image Processing Techniques

## Basic Image Operations

### Image Filtering
*   Convolution operation: Applying a filter (kernel) to an image.
    ```
    import numpy as np
    import cv2

    # Define a simple averaging filter
    kernel = np.ones((5,5),np.float32)/25

    # Apply the filter
    img = cv2.imread('image.jpg')
    filtered_img = cv2.filter2D(img,-1,kernel)
    ```
*   Blurring: Averaging, Gaussian blur, Median blur.
    *   Averaging blur: Reduces noise by averaging pixel values in a neighborhood.
    *   Gaussian blur: Applies a Gaussian kernel for smoother blurring.
    *   Median blur: Replaces each pixel with the median value of its neighbors, effective for salt-and-pepper noise.

### Edge Detection

### Image Thresholding
*   Global thresholding: Applying a single threshold value to the entire image.
    *   Binary thresholding: Pixels above the threshold are set to a maximum value, others to zero.
    *   Inverse binary thresholding: Pixels above the threshold are set to zero, others to a maximum value.
*   Adaptive thresholding: Varying the threshold value based on local image characteristics.
    *   Mean adaptive thresholding: Threshold is the mean of the neighborhood area.
    *   Gaussian adaptive thresholding: Threshold is the weighted sum of neighborhood values, where weights are a Gaussian kernel.
