### System Requirements #Prerequisites #Compatibility
Node.js version, operating system support.
### Installation Methods #NPM #Yarn #DirectDownload
Using package managers or downloading directly.
    `npm install cypress --save-dev`
    `yarn add cypress --dev`
### Project Initialization #FolderStructure #InitCommand

### First Test Example #HelloWorld #BasicTest
Writing and running a simple initial test.

## Writing Tests #Syntax #API #TestStructure
The core syntax and structure for creating Cypress tests.
### Test Files #SpecFiles #NamingConvention
Convention for naming test files (e.g., `*.cy.js`, `*.spec.js`).
### Test Structure #Mocha #Describe #It
Using Mocha's BDD syntax (`describe()`, `context()`, `it()`, `specify()`).
### Hooks #Lifecycle #SetupTeardown
`before()`, `after()`, `beforeEach()`, `afterEach()` for setup and teardown.
### Test Configuration #Skipping #Including
`.skip()`, `.only()` for controlling test execution.
### Test Case Best Practices #Readability #Maintainability
Writing clear, concise, and independent tests.

## Cypress Test Runner #GUI #CLI #Execution
Tools provided by Cypress for executing and managing tests.
### Test Runner GUI #InteractiveMode #CypressOpen
Launching (`cypress open`), features (test status, command log, selector playground, time travel).
### Command Line Interface (CLI) #HeadlessMode #CypressRun
Running tests headlessly (`cypress run`), options (browser selection, specs, reporting).
### Selector Playground #ElementSelection #DebuggingAid
Interactively finding unique selectors for elements.
### Time Travel Debugging #Debugging #CommandLog
Stepping through commands and seeing application state snapshots.

## Interacting with the DOM #Commands #Actions #Elements
Using Cypress commands to find and interact with web page elements.
### Selecting Elements #Selectors #Querying
`cy.get()`, `cy.contains()`, CSS selectors, text content.
### Chaining Commands #ImplicitAssertions #Workflow
How Cypress commands queue and execute sequentially.
### Common Actions #UserSimulation #Events
`.click()`, `.type()`, `.check()`, `.select()`, `.scrollIntoView()`, `.trigger()`.
### Traversing the DOM #Navigation #Relationships
`.parent()`, `.siblings()`, `.children()`, `.find()`, `.next()`, `.prev()`, `.closest()`.
### Visibility #Assertions #DOMState
Handling element presence and visibility (`should('be.visible')`, `should('not.exist')`).

## Assertions #Validation #Checks #Verification

Using `expect()` with Chai BDD syntax.
### Common Assertion Patterns #Chai #ChaiJquery #SinonChai
Checking text, values, attributes, classes, CSS properties, counts.
Bundled libraries: Chai, Chai-jQuery, Sinon-Chai.
### Negative Assertions #NotExist #NotVisible
Asserting the absence of elements or states (`.should('not.exist')`, `.should('not.be.visible')`).
### Retry-ability #AutomaticWaiting #Stability
How Cypress automatically retries assertions until they pass or time out.

## Handling Asynchronicity #Async #Timing #Waits
Managing asynchronous operations inherent in web applications.
### The Command Queue #ExecutionModel #Promises
