### Tangent Sum and Difference
*   tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B), tan(A - B) = (tan A - tan B) / (1 + tan A tan B)

### Half-Angle Formulas
*   sin(θ/2) = ±√((1 - cos θ)/2), cos(θ/2) = ±√((1 + cos θ)/2), tan(θ/2) = ±√((1 - cos θ)/(1 + cos θ)) = (sin θ) / (1 + cos θ) = (1 - cos θ) / (sin θ)
