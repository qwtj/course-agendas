An overview of tools and techniques for analyzing software without executing it.

## Fundamentals of Static Analysis #Basics #Theory #Concepts
Core principles and theoretical background of static analysis.

### Definition and Purpose #WhatIsSAST #Goals
Defining static analysis and explaining its objectives in software development, such as finding bugs, security vulnerabilities, and enforcing coding standards early.

### Static vs. Dynamic Analysis #Comparison #TestingTypes
Contrasting static analysis (analyzing code at rest) with dynamic analysis (analyzing code during execution).

### History and Evolution #Origins #Development
Tracing the development of static analysis techniques and tools over time.

## How Static Analysis Works #Techniques #Methodologies #Process
The underlying mechanisms and approaches used by static analysis tools.

### Parsing and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) #CodeRepresentation #Parsing
How tools parse source code into intermediate representations like ASTs for analysis.

### Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) #ProgramFlow #GraphTheory
Representing the possible execution paths through a program.

### Data Flow Analysis #DataTracking #VariableState
Tracking the flow and state of data (variables, pointers) through the program to detect potential issues like null pointer dereferences or uninitialized variables.

### Taint Analysis #Security #DataFlow #VulnerabilityDetection
Tracking potentially untrusted input (tainted data) to see if it reaches sensitive sinks (execution points) without proper sanitization.

### Symbolic Execution #PathExploration #FormalMethods
Exploring program paths using symbolic values instead of concrete data to reason about program behavior across multiple inputs.

### Pattern Matching / Lexical Analysis #SimpleChecks #Syntax
Basic analysis based on matching code patterns or lexical tokens, often used for style checking or finding simple anti-patterns.

### Type Checking and Inference #TypeSafety #LanguageFeatures
Verifying or inferring variable types to prevent type errors, a fundamental form of static analysis built into many compilers.

### Model Checking #FormalVerification #StateExploration
Verifying if a system model (derived from code) satisfies certain properties, often used for concurrent systems.

## Types of Issues Detected #Bugs #Vulnerabilities #CodeSmells
Categories of problems that static analysis tools are designed to identify.

### Security Vulnerabilities #OWASP #CWE #SecurityFlaws
Identifying common security flaws like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), buffer overflows, insecure API usage, etc.

### Code Quality Defects #Bugs #Reliability #Maintainability
Finding potential bugs such as null pointer exceptions, resource leaks, race conditions, dead code, and logical errors.

### Coding Standard Violations #StyleGuides #Consistency #Readability
Enforcing adherence to predefined coding conventions and style guides (e.g., MISRA C, CERT C, Google Style Guide).

### Performance Issues #Optimization #Efficiency
Identifying inefficient code patterns, potential bottlenecks, or suboptimal resource usage.
Note: Performance analysis is often better handled by dynamic analysis/profiling, but static analysis can find some anti-patterns.
