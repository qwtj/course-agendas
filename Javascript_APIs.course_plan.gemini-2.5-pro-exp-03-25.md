    }
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  }
}
fetchData();
```

*Cross-reference: Refer back to error handling examples for Fetch (Section II) and Async/Await (Section III).*

### Handling Network Errors vs. API Errors
"Differentiate between network-level errors (e.g., request couldn't be sent, DNS lookup failed) typically caught by `.catch()` or `try...catch`, and API-level errors indicated by HTTP status codes (e.g., 4xx, 5xx) present in the `response` object."

## Debugging API Interactions
"Describe common techniques and tools for debugging JavaScript code that interacts with APIs:
*   Using browser developer tools (Network tab to inspect requests/responses, Console tab for logs/errors).

### Inspecting Network Requests/Responses
"Explain how to use the browser's Network tab to examine the details of an API request (URL, method, headers, payload) and its corresponding response (status code, headers, body)."

## Performance Optimization Techniques
"Discuss techniques to improve the performance of applications relying heavily on API calls:
*   **Caching:** Implementing client-side caching (using Web Storage or Service Workers) or leveraging HTTP caching headers (`Cache-Control`).
*   **Reducing Request Payload:** Only requesting the data needed (especially relevant for GraphQL).
*   **Debouncing/Throttling:** Limiting the frequency of API calls triggered by user input (e.g., search suggestions).
*   **Concurrent Requests:** Using `Promise.all()` for independent requests where appropriate."
*Cross-reference: Mention Service Worker caching (Section IV) and `Promise.all` (Section III).*
