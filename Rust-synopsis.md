Learning Objectives: Understand Rust's core principles (memory safety, concurrency, zero-cost abstractions), basic syntax, ownership/borrowing, data structures, error handling, concurrency, traits/generics, and testing.

Prerequisites: Basic programming concepts (variables, data types, control flow, functions).

Depth & Scope: Overview to intermediate, focusing on fundamental concepts and practical examples.

Target Audience: Entry-level to intermediate Rust developers.

Technical Details: Code examples for each concept, including `rustup` installation, `cargo` commands, variable declarations, control flow, function definitions, struct/enum definitions, vector/hashmap usage, error handling with `Result` and `panic!`, thread creation/joining, message passing, mutexes, trait/generic definitions, and unit tests.

Relevant Technologies/Tools: Rust, Cargo.

Preferred Format/Length: Detailed explanations with concise examples.
