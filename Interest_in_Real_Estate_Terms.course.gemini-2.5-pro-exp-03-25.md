# I. Foundational Real Estate Concepts
*   **Learning Objective:** To understand basic property types, core transaction vocabulary, and the roles of key individuals involved in real estate dealings.

## Understanding Property Types
"Explain the primary classifications of real estate property, including `residential`, `commercial`, `industrial`, `agricultural`, and `special purpose` properties. Provide defining characteristics for each."

### Residential Property Subtypes
"Describe common subtypes of residential property, such as `single-family home`, `condominium` (`condo`), `cooperative` (`co-op`), `townhouse`, `multi-family dwelling` (e.g., duplex, triplex), and `manufactured home`. Briefly outline the ownership structure differences, particularly between condos and co-ops."
*   "Provide examples distinguishing a `condominium` ownership structure from a `cooperative` ownership structure."

### Commercial Property Subtypes
"Detail various types of commercial real estate, including `office buildings`, `retail space` (e.g., shopping centers, strip malls), `hotels/hospitality`, and `mixed-use` properties. Explain the typical use case for each."

## Core Transaction Terminology
"Define fundamental terms used in nearly every real estate transaction. Include definitions for `buyer`, `seller`, `real estate agent`/`broker`, `listing`, `offer`, `acceptance`, `contract`, `closing`/`settlement`, and `escrow`."

### Offer and Acceptance Process
"Explain the terms related to making and accepting an offer on a property, such as `purchase offer`, `counteroffer`, `contingency` (e.g., financing contingency, inspection contingency), `earnest money deposit`, and `binding agreement`."
*   "Give an example scenario illustrating how a `counteroffer` modifies an initial `purchase offer`."

## Key Parties in a Transaction
"Identify and describe the roles of the essential parties involved in a typical real estate transaction beyond the buyer and seller. Include `listing agent`, `buyer's agent`, `real estate broker`, `mortgage lender`/`loan officer`, `appraiser`, `home inspector`, `title company`/`escrow agent`, and `real estate attorney` (if applicable)."
