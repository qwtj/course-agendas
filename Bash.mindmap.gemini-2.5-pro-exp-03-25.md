# Bash #Shell #Scripting #CLI
Bash (Bourne-Again Shell) is a widely used Unix shell and command language interpreter. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the operating system and a powerful scripting language for automation. [9, 11, 15, 19]

## Introduction and Core Concepts #Basics #Overview #Shell
Understanding the fundamentals of Bash, its history, and its role in Unix-like systems.
Bash is an enhanced version of the original Bourne Shell (sh) and incorporates features from other shells like Korn Shell (ksh) and C Shell (csh). [19, 20] It acts as an intermediary, translating user commands into actions performed by the operating system kernel. [7, 10]

### What is a Shell? #Definition #Interface #Interpreter
A program that interprets user commands and interacts with the operating system kernel. [4, 7, 9, 10] Shells provide the command-line interface. [4, 9]

### History of Bash #Origins #Evolution #GNU
Created by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne Shell. [4, 19] It's largely compatible with `sh` but adds many enhancements. [11, 19]

### Interactive vs. Non-Interactive Use #Modes #Usage
Bash can be used directly in a terminal (interactive) or to execute scripts stored in files (non-interactive). [11]

### Basic Shell Operation #Workflow #Execution
Reading input, parsing commands, performing expansions, executing commands, and displaying output. [11, 19]

## Shell Environment and Configuration #Setup #Customization #Environment
Managing the shell's operating environment, including startup files and variables.

### Startup Files #Configuration #Login #Bashrc
Files executed when Bash starts, used for setting up the environment. [5]
#### Login Shells #Profile #Bash_profile #Bash_login
Read `/etc/profile` first, then the first found of `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bash_login`, or `~/.profile`. [5, 18, 22] Used for settings needed once per login session (e.g., setting PATH). [5]
#### Non-Login Shells #Bashrc
Read `/etc/bashrc` and `~/.bashrc`. [5, 22] Used for settings needed for every interactive shell instance (e.g., aliases, prompt settings). [5]

### Environment Variables #Variables #Export #Scope
Variables affecting the shell environment and child processes. [1, 5, 15]
#### Definition and Types #Local #Global #System
Variables can be local (session-specific) or global (persistent, accessible by child processes). System-wide variables affect all users. [15, 22]
#### Common Variables #PATH #HOME #PS1 #TERM
Key variables like `PATH` (command search path), `HOME` (user's home directory), `PS1` (command prompt appearance). [5, 18]
#### Setting and Exporting #Export #Set #Unset
Using `export VARNAME=value` to make variables available to child processes. [15, 21, 22]

### Aliases #Shortcuts #Commands
Creating shorthand names for longer commands. Typically defined in `~/.bashrc`. [5]

### Shell Options #Set #Shopt
Modifying shell behavior using `set` and `shopt` built-in commands (e.g., `set -e` to exit on error, `set -x` for debugging). [8, 17, 18]

## Commands and Execution #Execution #Builtins #External
Understanding how Bash finds, interprets, and runs commands.

### Command Types #Builtin #External #Function #Alias
Distinguishing between commands built into the shell, external programs found via PATH, shell functions, and aliases. [7, 12]

### Command Syntax #Arguments #Options #Syntax
Structure of a command: `command [options] [arguments]`. [1]

### Command History #History #Recall #Reuse
Bash keeps a history of executed commands, accessible via arrow keys, `history` command, and shortcuts (e.g., `!!`, `!$`). [1]

### Job Control #Background #Foreground #Jobs
Managing processes running in the shell. [1]
#### Foreground and Background Processes #fg #bg #&
Running commands in the background (`&`) and bringing them to the foreground (`fg`) or background (`bg`). [1]
#### Suspending Processes #CtrlZ
Pausing a foreground process (e.g., using `Ctrl+Z`).

### Command Substitution #Execution #Output #Substitution
Capturing the output of a command to use it as part of another command (e.g., `$(command)` or 
``` `command` ```
). [1]

## Input/Output Redirection and Pipelines #IO #Redirection #Pipes
Controlling where command input comes from and where output goes.

### Standard Streams #stdin #stdout #stderr
Understanding the three standard file descriptors: Standard Input (0), Standard Output (1), and Standard Error (2).

### Redirecting Output #Overwrite #Append #Files
Sending stdout (`>`), stderr (`2>`), or both (`&>`) to files. Overwriting (`>`) or appending (`>>`). [1, 19]

### Redirecting Input #Input #Files #HereDocs
Taking input for a command from a file (`<`). [19]
#### Here Documents #HereDoc #Input
Providing multi-line input directly within a script (`<<EOF`).

### Pipelines #Pipes #Chaining #Workflow
Connecting the stdout of one command to the stdin of another using the pipe operator (`|`). [1, 11, 19]

## Variables and Data Types #Variables #Data #Parameters
Storing and manipulating data within Bash.

### Shell vs. Environment Variables #Scope #Export
Shell variables are local to the current shell; environment variables are passed to child processes. [15]

### Variable Assignment and Referencing #Assignment #Expansion

#### Single Quotes (`' '`) #Literal
Prevent all expansions. [19]
#### Double Quotes (`" "`) #Expansion

#### Escape Character (`\`) #Escape
Remove the special meaning of the next character. [19]

### Shell Expansions #Expansion #Substitution #Generation
Mechanisms Bash uses to transform commands before execution. [11, 19]
#### Brace Expansion (`{a,b}`) #Generation #Sequence

#### Tilde Expansion (`~`) #Home #Directory

#### Parameter Expansion (`${VAR}`) #Variables #Manipulation
Manipulate variable values (e.g., `${VAR:-default}`, `${VAR%suffix}`). [19]
#### Arithmetic Expansion (`$(( ))`) #Math #Calculation
Perform integer arithmetic. [19]
#### Process Substitution (`<( )`, `>( )`) #Files #Pipes
Treat the output/input of a process as a file. [19]
#### Filename Expansion (Globbing) #Wildcards #Patterns #Files
