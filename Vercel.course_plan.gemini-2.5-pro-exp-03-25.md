# X. Vercel CLI and Infrastructure as Code
*   **Learning Objective:** Learn how to install and use the Vercel Command Line Interface (CLI) for common tasks like local development, deployment, log streaming, environment variable management, and understand its role in automating workflows and potential integration with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools.

## Introduction to Vercel CLI
"Generate instructions on how to install the Vercel CLI globally using npm (`npm install -g vercel`) and how to log in to your Vercel account using `vercel login`."

## Common CLI Commands (`vercel dev`, `vercel deploy`, `vercel logs`, `vercel env`)
"Generate descriptions and usage examples for the following essential Vercel CLI commands:
*   `vercel dev`: Run a local development server that emulates the Vercel environment (including Serverless Functions).
*   `vercel` or `vercel deploy`: Deploy the current project directory to Vercel (use `vercel --prod` for production deployments).
*   `vercel logs <deployment-url-or-project-name>`: View real-time or historical logs for a deployment or project.
*   `vercel env ls`, `vercel env add <name> <value>`, `vercel env rm <name>`: List, add, and remove environment variables for a project."

## Automating Deployments with CLI
"Generate examples of how the Vercel CLI (`vercel deploy --prod --token $VERCEL_TOKEN --yes`) can be incorporated into CI/CD pipelines (like GitHub Actions) to automate production deployments triggered by specific events (e.g., merge to main branch)."

## Managing Projects Programmatically (Optional: Terraform Provider)
"Generate a brief mention that for advanced use cases involving managing Vercel project configurations (domains, environment variables, settings) as code, tools like the unofficial Vercel Provider for Terraform exist, enabling Infrastructure as Code practices."

*   **Section Summary:** The Vercel CLI provides powerful command-line control over Vercel projects, enabling local development emulation (`vercel dev`), deployments, log streaming, environment variable management, and automation within CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Glossary:**
    *   `CLI (Command Line Interface)`: A text-based interface used to interact with software or operating systems by typing commands.
    *   `Infrastructure as Code (IaC)`: The practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure (like servers, databases, network configurations, Vercel projects) through machine-readable definition files (code), rather than manual configuration.
*   **Quiz:**
    1.  What command installs the Vercel CLI?
    2.  Which CLI command simulates the Vercel environment on your local machine?
    3.  How can you deploy directly to production using the CLI?
    4.  What CLI command would you use to add a new API key as an environment variable?
