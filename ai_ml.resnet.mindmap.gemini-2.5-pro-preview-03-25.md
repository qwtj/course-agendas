# ResNet #DeepLearning #ComputerVision
ResNet (Residual Network) is a seminal deep learning architecture introduced in 2015, famous for enabling the training of significantly deeper neural networks by using residual connections (skip connections).

## Introduction and Motivation #Problem #Background
Understanding the context and challenges that led to the development of ResNet.

### The Challenge of Deep Networks #DeepLearning #TrainingIssues
Difficulties encountered when training very deep neural networks before ResNet.

#### Vanishing/Exploding Gradients #Gradients #OptimizationProblem
As networks get deeper, gradients propagated backward can become extremely small (vanish) or large (explode), hindering learning in early layers. Batch Normalization helps but doesn't fully solve the deeper network issues. #VanishingGradient #ExplodingGradient

#### Degradation Problem #Accuracy #PerformanceLimit
Observation that with increasing network depth, accuracy first saturates and then rapidly degrades, even on the training set. This is not caused by overfitting but by optimization difficulties. #DegradationProblem

#### Optimization Difficulty #Learning #Convergence
Hypothesis that deeper "plain" networks (without residual connections) are harder to optimize, potentially having exponentially low convergence rates, making it difficult for added layers to learn identity mappings. #Optimization

### Pre-ResNet Architectures #History #CNN
Brief overview of architectures like VGG that demonstrated performance gains with depth but hit limits. #VGG #AlexNet

#### VGG Networks #VGG #DeepCNN
Showed that depth was important but suffered from degradation and vanishing gradients when pushed too deep (e.g., beyond 19 layers effectively).

## Core Concept: Residual Learning #FundamentalIdea #Innovation
The central idea introduced by ResNet to overcome the challenges of deep networks.

### Residual Mapping #LearningParadigm #FunctionApproximation
Instead of learning a direct mapping H(x), layers learn a residual function F(x) = H(x) - x. The original mapping is then reconstructed as H(x) = F(x) + x. #ResidualFunction

### Identity Shortcut Connections (Skip Connections) #Architecture #Connectivity
Connections that bypass one or more layers, adding the input 'x' to the output of the bypassed layers F(x). #SkipConnection #Shortcut

#### Enabling Identity Mapping #OptimizationGoal #EaseOfLearning
If the optimal function for a block is close to an identity mapping (output = input), the residual F(x) only needs to learn to be zero, which is easier for optimizers. #IdentityMapping

#### Improved Gradient Flow #Backpropagation #TrainingStability
Shortcut connections provide a direct path for gradients to flow back through the network, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and stabilizing training. #GradientFlow

## Architecture Details #Structure #BuildingBlocks
Specific components and overall structure of ResNet models.

### Residual Blocks #CoreUnit #DesignPattern
The fundamental building units of ResNet.

#### Basic Block #ResNet18 #ResNet34
Typically consists of two 3x3 convolutional layers with Batch Normalization and ReLU activation, and a shortcut connection adding the input to the output. Used in shallower ResNets like ResNet-18 and ResNet-34. #BasicBlock

#### Bottleneck Block #ResNet50 #ResNet101 #ResNet152
Uses three convolutional layers: 1x1 (reduce dimension), 3x3, and 1x1 (restore dimension). More parameter-efficient for deeper networks like ResNet-50, ResNet-101, ResNet-152. #BottleneckBlock

#### Identity vs. Projection Shortcuts #DimensionMatching #ConnectivityOptions
- **Identity Shortcut:** Used when input and output dimensions are the same. Simply adds input to output.
- **Projection Shortcut:** Used when dimensions change (e.g., due to increased channels or strided convolution). Typically uses a 1x1 convolution on the input path to match output dimensions. #ProjectionShortcut

### Overall Network Structure #MacroArchitecture #LayerStacking
How residual blocks are stacked to form the complete network.

#### Initial Convolutional Layer #InputProcessing #FeatureExtraction
Typically starts with a larger kernel convolution (e.g., 7x7) and max-pooling, similar to VGG/GoogLeNet.

#### Stacking Residual Blocks #Deepening #Modules
Multiple residual blocks are stacked in stages or modules. Within a stage, feature map size is usually constant, while channel depth might increase between stages.

#### Downsampling #FeatureMapSize #Stride
Downsampling is typically performed by convolutions with a stride of 2, often at the beginning of a stage (potentially within the projection shortcut).

#### Global Average Pooling (GAP) #ClassifierHead #Reduction
Replaces traditional fully connected layers before the final classifier, reducing parameters and overfitting. #GlobalAveragePooling

#### Final Classifier Layer #Output #Prediction
A fully connected layer outputs the final class scores.

## Mathematical Formulation #Theory #Equations
Expressing the core concepts mathematically.

### Residual Block Formulation #Formula #Definition
y = F(x, {Wi}) + x
Where 'x' is input, 'y' is output, and F represents the residual mapping learned by the layers {Wi}.

### Projection Shortcut Formulation #Formula #DimensionChange
y = F(x, {Wi}) + Ws * x
Where Ws is a projection matrix (implemented via 1x1 convolution) to match dimensions.

### Optimization Algorithm #Optimizer #SGD

### Initialization #WeightInitialization #StartingPoint
Careful weight initialization (e.g., He initialization) is important.

### Batch Normalization (BN) #Normalization #Stabilization
Crucial component used typically after each convolution and before activation. Stabilizes learning, allows higher learning rates, and provides regularization. #BatchNormalization #InternalCovariateShift
- **BN mechanism:** Normalizes activations within a mini-batch.
- **BN during inference:** Uses running averages of mean/variance estimated during training.
- **BN challenges:** Performance can degrade with very small batch sizes or non-IID data due to inaccurate statistic estimation. #BNIssues

Often starts with a relatively high learning rate, which is decreased periodically (e.g., stepped decay, cosine decay). #LearningRate

### Regularization #Overfitting #Generalization
Weight decay is commonly used. Dropout is typically *not* used in the original ResNet design, as BN provides some regularization. #WeightDecay #Regularization
