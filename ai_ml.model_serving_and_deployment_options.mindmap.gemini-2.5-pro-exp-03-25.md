# AI Model Serving and Deployment Options #MLOps #Deployment #Serving
Overview of strategies, tools, and infrastructure for making trained AI models available for inference in production environments.

## Foundational Concepts #Basics #CoreIdeas #Terminology
Understanding the core principles behind model deployment and serving.

### What is Model Serving? #Definition #Purpose #Inference
The process of making a trained machine learning model available to receive input data and return predictions, typically via an API.

### What is Model Deployment? #Definition #Lifecycle #Integration
The broader process of taking a validated model and integrating it into a target production environment (application, business process) so it can be used by end-users or systems.

### Key Differences: Serving vs. Deployment #Comparison #Distinction
Deployment encompasses the entire release process, including infrastructure setup, versioning, and integration, while serving specifically refers to running the model for inference requests.

### Inference Types #Prediction #Batch #RealTime #Streaming
Different ways models can generate predictions based on application needs.
    #### Real-time/Online Inference #LowLatency #APIs #Interactive
    Serving single or small-batch predictions on demand with low latency requirements.
    #### Batch Inference #Offline #ScheduledJobs #Throughput
    Processing large datasets offline, often on a schedule, prioritizing throughput over latency.
    #### Streaming Inference #ContinuousData #RealTimeProcessing #MicroBatch
    Making predictions on continuous data streams, often using micro-batches.

### The ML Lifecycle Context #MLOps #Pipeline #Workflow
Understanding where deployment and serving fit within the end-to-end machine learning process (data preparation, training, evaluation, deployment, monitoring).

## Deployment Strategies and Patterns #Patterns #Methods #Approaches
Common architectural patterns and methodologies for releasing models into production safely and effectively.

### Direct Embedding / On-Device #EdgeAI #Mobile #IoT #Offline
Integrating the model library directly into the application code or deploying it onto end-user devices.
    #### Advantages #LowLatency #OfflineAccess #DataPrivacy #ReducedInfrastructureCost
    #### Disadvantages #ResourceConstraints #UpdateChallenges #PlatformHeterogeneity

### API Endpoint Deployment #Microservices #WebServices #Scalability #Decoupling
Exposing the model's prediction functionality via a network-accessible API (e.g., REST, gRPC). This is the most common pattern for web applications.
    #### REST APIs #HTTP #JSON #Simplicity #WidelyCompatible
    #### gRPC APIs #Protobuf #Performance #Streaming #BiDirectional

### Shadow Deployment (Dark Launch) #Testing #Validation #RiskReduction #Comparison
Deploying a new model version alongside the current production version, sending production traffic to both but only using the old model's results. Allows for performance and prediction comparison without user impact.

### Canary Deployment #GradualRollout #RiskMitigation #A-BTesting #SubsetTraffic
Gradually shifting a small percentage of production traffic to the new model version, monitoring closely, and increasing the percentage if stable.

### Blue-Green Deployment #ZeroDowntime #Rollback #InfrastructureDuplication #InstantSwitch
Maintaining two identical production environments ('Blue' - current, 'Green' - new). Traffic is switched from Blue to Green once Green is verified. Allows for instant rollback by switching back to Blue.

### Multi-Armed Bandit Deployment #Optimization #ExplorationExploitation #AdaptiveRouting #OnlineLearning
Dynamically allocating traffic to multiple model versions based on their observed performance (e.g., click-through rate, conversion rate), balancing exploring new options and exploiting known good ones.
