# STAF Automation #Framework #Testing #OpenSource
Software Testing Automation Framework (STAF) is an open-source, multi-platform, multi-language framework designed around reusable components called services. It provides an infrastructure for building distributed test environments and automating test cases.

## Introduction to STAF #Overview #Basics
Provides a foundational understanding of STAF, its purpose, and context.
### What is STAF? #Definition #Concept
Explanation of the Software Testing Automation Framework.
An open-source, cross-platform framework promoting reusability in test automation through a service-based architecture.
### Purpose and Goals #Objectives #Benefits
Why STAF was created and what problems it solves (e.g., automating complex distributed tests, environment setup, results collection).
Key goals: Reusability, Interoperability, Platform/Language Independence.
Reduces the effort of building custom automation infrastructure.
### History and Evolution #Background #Development
Origins (IBM), key release milestones (Initial 1998, v3 2005), licensing (EPL).
Note: Latest release seems to be 3.4.26 from Dec 2016, indicating potentially reduced active development.
### Key Features #Capabilities #Highlights
Multi-platform support (Windows, Linux, Mac OS, etc.).
Multi-language support (APIs for Java, Python, C++, Perl, Tcl, Rexx).
Service-oriented architecture.
Peer-to-peer communication model.
Extensibility (custom service development).

## STAF Architecture #Core #Design
Describes the fundamental components and how they interact.
### Core Components #BuildingBlocks #Structure
#### STAF Daemon (STAFProc) #Process #CoreEngine
The central process running on each machine in the STAF environment. Manages services and communication.
#### Services #Components #Modules
Reusable units providing specific functionalities (e.g., Process, Log, File System).
##### Internal Services #BuiltIn #CoreFunctionality
Services integrated directly into STAFProc (e.g., PING, VAR, SERVICE, MISC, HANDLE).
##### External Services #Plugins #Extensions
Services implemented externally (e.g., Java JARs, shared libraries) and registered with STAFProc (e.g., EVENT, EMAIL, HTTP, STAX).
#### Handles #Identifier #Session
Unique identifier for each process registered with STAF. Used to track requests and manage resources (variable pools, queues).
Handle 1 is reserved for STAFProc itself.
#### Requests and Responses #Communication #Interaction
The format and mechanism for interacting with STAF services.
Format: `STAF <Endpoint> <Service> <Request>`
#### Variable Pools #Data #Storage
Mechanisms for storing and retrieving data associated with handles or globally (e.g., STAF/Client/Handle/{HandleNum}/Variable, STAF/Service/{ServiceName}/Variable).
#### Queues #IPC #Messaging
STAF provides a built-in message queue service for inter-process communication.
#### Security Model #Authentication #Trust
How STAF manages trust between machines and authenticates requests.
##### Trust Levels #Permissions #SecurityLevels
Different levels defining permissions for requests between machines (e.g., Level 0-5).
