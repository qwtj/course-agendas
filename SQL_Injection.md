# I. SQL Injection Fundamentals

## Understanding SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

### Definition and Explanation
Explain the concept of SQL injection: manipulating SQL queries via user input.

### Common Injection Points
Identify typical areas vulnerable to SQL injection: form fields, URL parameters, cookies.

### Types of SQL Injection
*   **Classic SQL Injection:** Direct manipulation of queries.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** Inferring database structure through application response.
*   **Second-Order SQL Injection:** Injection that occurs later in the application lifecycle.

## Analyzing SQL Injection Attacks

### Identifying Vulnerable Code
Learn to recognize code patterns that are prone to SQL injection, e.g., string concatenation in query construction. Example: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '"+ userInput + "'`

### Testing for SQL Injection
Methods to test for SQL injection vulnerabilities, including manual testing and automated tools.

### Common Injection Payloads
Examples of common SQL injection payloads:
*   `' OR '1'='1` (always true condition)
*   `; DROP TABLE users;` (destructive action)
*   `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --` (data retrieval)

# II. SQL Injection Prevention Techniques

## Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)

### Understanding Parameterized Queries
Explanation of parameterized queries: separating SQL code from user input.

### Implementing Parameterized Queries
Examples in different programming languages (e.g., Python, PHP, Java) showing how to correctly use parameterized queries:
```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
username = 'user'
password = 'password'
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?", (username, password))
```

## Input Validation and Sanitization

### Implementing Input Validation
Techniques to validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and values.

### Data Sanitization Methods
Explain and implement data sanitization techniques to remove or escape potentially malicious characters.  Example: `htmlspecialchars()` in PHP, escaping special characters in other languages.

### Whitelisting vs. Blacklisting
Discuss the benefits of whitelisting (allowing only known good characters) over blacklisting (blocking known bad characters).

## Least Privilege Principle

### Applying the Principle
Granting only the necessary database privileges to application users.

### Limiting Database User Permissions
Restricting the database user's ability to modify table structures or access sensitive data.

# III. Advanced SQL Injection Defense

## Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)

### Understanding WAFs
What are Web Application Firewalls and how they protect against web application vulnerabilities.

### Configuring WAFs
Basic WAF configuration to block common SQL injection patterns.

### Bypass Techniques
Understanding techniques attackers use to bypass WAF protection.

## Error Handling and Logging

### Secure Error Handling
Preventing sensitive information from being disclosed in error messages.

### Detailed Logging
Implementing comprehensive logging to detect and respond to suspicious activity.

## Database Security Hardening

### Stored Procedures
Using stored procedures to encapsulate SQL logic and reduce attack surface.

### Encryption
Encrypting sensitive data stored in the database.

### Auditing
Implementing database auditing to track user actions and identify potential security breaches.

# IV. SQL Injection in Different Database Systems

## MySQL Specifics

Techniques specific to MySQL, such as using backticks to bypass filtering.

### MySQL Security Best Practices
Specific security configurations and practices for MySQL.

## PostgreSQL Specifics

### PostgreSQL Injection Techniques

### PostgreSQL Security Best Practices
Specific security configurations and practices for PostgreSQL.

## Microsoft SQL Server Specifics

### SQL Server Injection Techniques

### SQL Server Security Best Practices
Specific security configurations and practices for SQL Server.

# V. SQL Injection Tools and Resources

## SQLMap

### Using SQLMap
Learning to use the `sqlmap` tool for automated SQL injection detection and exploitation.

### SQLMap Command Examples
Examples of using `sqlmap` to test for vulnerabilities, enumerate databases, and extract data.

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/article.php?id=1" --dbs
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/article.php?id=1" -D database_name --tables
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/article.php?id=1" -D database_name -T table_name --columns
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/article.php?id=1" -D database_name -T table_name -C column1,column2 --dump
```

# VI. Practical SQL Injection Exercises and Projects

## Vulnerable Web Application Setup

### Setting up DVWA or similar
Setting up Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) or a similar intentionally vulnerable application.

### Configuring the environment
Configure the chosen web app.

## Exploiting Vulnerabilities

### Practice exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities
Exploiting different types of SQL injection vulnerabilities within the vulnerable application.

### Documenting Exploitation Process
Documenting the steps taken to identify and exploit each vulnerability.

## Fixing Vulnerabilities

### Identifying and fixing SQL injection vulnerabilities
Fixing identified SQL injection vulnerabilities using parameterized queries and input validation.

### Re-testing the application
Re-testing the application to ensure the vulnerabilities have been successfully remediated.

## Secure Coding Project
Develop a simple web application that interacts with a database, ensuring that all SQL queries are properly parameterized and input validation is implemented.
