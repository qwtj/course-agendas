# SW Build Systems #Overview #Automation
Software Build Systems encompass the tools and processes used to transform source code and other assets into deployable software artifacts, managing dependencies, compilation, testing, and packaging. They automate complex workflows, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

## Fundamentals of Build Systems #Basics #Concepts
Introduction to the core purpose, benefits, and essential ideas behind build systems.

### What is a Build System? #Definition #Purpose
A framework or set of tools automating the software build process, including compiling, linking, testing, and packaging. They streamline development by managing complexity.

### Why Use a Build System? #Benefits #Motivation
Reasons for adopting build systems include consistency, efficiency, scalability, reproducibility, dependency management, and integration with other development processes like CI/CD.

### Key Goals #Objectives #Principles
Core objectives like correctness (ensuring the build output accurately reflects the source), minimality (rebuilding only what's necessary), performance, and reproducibility.

## Core Concepts #Fundamentals #BuildingBlocks
The essential elements and ideas common across most build systems.

### Source Code #Input #Code
The raw code written by developers that serves as the primary input to the build process.

### Build Targets #Output #Goals
The desired outputs of the build process, such as executables, libraries, documentation, or packaged distributions. Build systems work to produce these targets.

### Build Rules / Tasks #Logic #Actions
Definitions that specify how to transform input files (sources, dependencies) into output files (targets). They often involve invoking compilers, linkers, or other tools.

### Dependencies #Relationships #Prerequisites
The relationships between files and build targets, indicating that a target requires certain inputs or other targets to be built first. Build systems use this to determine build order and what needs rebuilding.

### Dependency Graph #Structure #Visualization
The directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the dependencies between build targets and source files. Crucial for determining build order and parallel execution.

### Build Configuration #Settings #Customization
Files or scripts (e.g., `Makefile`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `BUILD`) used to define targets, dependencies, rules, variables, and other build parameters for the system.

### Build Environment #Context #Execution
The specific context, including operating system, toolchain versions, environment variables, and installed libraries, in which the build is executed. Ensuring consistency is key (hermeticity).

### Artifacts #Output #Results
The final products generated by the build process, such as compiled code, libraries, executable files, or packaged archives ready for deployment or distribution.
