# Vector Databases #Overview #AI #DataManagement
Specialized databases designed to store, manage, index, and search high-dimensional vector data, typically embeddings generated by machine learning models. They are crucial for applications involving similarity search on unstructured data.

## Fundamentals of Vector Databases #Basics #Concepts
Core ideas and motivations behind vector databases.

### What are Vector Databases? #Definition #Purpose
Databases optimized for vector data, contrasting with traditional relational or NoSQL databases that handle primarily structured or semi-structured data. [3, 5, 24]

### Why Vector Databases? #Motivation #Need
Addresses the limitations of traditional databases in handling high-dimensional, unstructured data (text, images, audio, video) and performing similarity searches based on semantic meaning rather than exact matches. [3, 7, 4] Enables AI/ML applications. [2, 3, 5]

### Comparison with Traditional Databases #Contrast #DatabaseTypes
-   **Data Model:** Vectors vs. Rows/Columns or Documents/Key-Value pairs. [3, 7]
-   **Querying:** Similarity Search (ANN) vs. Exact Match (SQL/NoSQL queries). [3, 7, 10]
-   **Data Types:** Optimized for high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) vs. Structured/Scalar data. [3, 5]
-   **Indexing:** Specialized vector indexes (HNSW, LSH, etc.) vs. B-trees, Hash indexes. [6]

## Core Concepts #Fundamentals #Theory
Essential theoretical building blocks.

### Vectors and Vector Spaces #Mathematics #Representation
Mathematical arrays representing data points in a multi-dimensional space. [3, 9, 10] Dimensions capture features or characteristics. [2, 4]

### Embeddings #ML #Representation #DataTransformation
Low-dimensional, dense vector representations of high-dimensional or unstructured data (text, images, audio, video) generated by machine learning models (e.g., word embeddings, image embeddings). [2, 9, 23, 24] Embeddings capture semantic meaning and relationships. [9, 10, 23]

### Dimensionality #VectorSpace #Characteristic
The number of dimensions in a vector, which can range from tens to thousands. [2, 3] High dimensionality poses challenges ("Curse of Dimensionality").

### Similarity Search #CoreFunctionality #Search
Finding vectors in the database that are closest or most similar to a given query vector based on a similarity metric. [2, 5, 10]

#### Similarity Metrics #Measurement #Distance
Functions used to quantify the similarity or distance between vectors.
-   **Cosine Similarity:** Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors (orientation). [9, 24, 25]
-   **Euclidean Distance (L2):** Straight-line distance between two points in the vector space. [9, 25]
-   **Dot Product:** Measures similarity considering both magnitude and angle.
-   **Manhattan Distance (L1):** Sum of absolute differences between coordinates. [9]
-   **Hamming Distance:** For binary vectors.

#### Nearest Neighbor (NN) Search #Algorithm #SearchType
Finding the exact closest vector(s) to a query vector. Computationally expensive for large, high-dimensional datasets.

#### Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Search #Algorithm #Optimization #SearchType
Algorithms that find *likely* nearest neighbors quickly, trading perfect accuracy for significant speed improvements. Essential for practical vector databases. [2, 23, 24] This is the core search mechanism in most vector databases. [22]

## Vector Indexing Techniques #Indexing #Performance #ANN
Methods used to organize vectors for efficient ANN search, avoiding exhaustive comparisons. [3, 6, 22]

### Need for Indexing #Efficiency #Challenge
Brute-force search is infeasible for large datasets. Indexing accelerates search by structuring the vector space. [3, 6, 22]

### Indexing Goals #Tradeoffs #Optimization
Balancing search speed (latency), accuracy (recall), memory usage, and index build time. [1, 11]

### Major Indexing Algorithms #Algorithms #DataStructures

#### Tree-based Indexes #Hierarchical #Partitioning
Divide the vector space recursively. [6, 11]
-   **KD-Trees:** Partitions space along dimensions. Efficient for lower dimensions, less so for high dimensions. [11, 23]
-   **Ball Trees:** Partitions space using hyperspheres. More robust to high dimensions than KD-trees. [11]
-   **VP-Trees (Vantage Point Trees):** Partitions based on distances to a chosen "vantage point". [23]

#### Hashing-based Indexes (LSH) #Hashing #Approximation
Use hash functions where similar vectors are likely to map to the same hash bucket. [1, 3, 11, 17, 25]
-   **Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH):** Family of hashing techniques for ANN. [1, 3, 17, 22, 25]

#### Graph-based Indexes #GraphTheory #Connectivity
Represent vectors as nodes in a graph where edges connect similar vectors. Search involves traversing the graph. [1, 11]
-   **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World):** State-of-the-art graph-based method known for high performance and accuracy. Builds multi-layered graphs for efficient navigation. [1, 3, 4, 12, 23] Very popular. [4]
-   **MSTG (Minimal Spanning Tree Graphs):** Another graph-based approach. [17]

#### Quantization-based Indexes #Compression #Approximation
Compress vectors to reduce memory usage and speed up distance calculations, often combined with other structures like IVF. [1, 3, 6, 11]
-   **Product Quantization (PQ):** Breaks vectors into chunks, quantizes each chunk separately. [1, 3, 11, 17]
-   **Scalar Quantization (SQ):** Compresses each vector component individually.

#### Inverted File Index (IVF) #Clustering #Partitioning
Clusters vectors (e.g., using k-means) and creates an inverted list mapping cluster centroids to the vectors within each cluster. Search is limited to relevant clusters. [17, 22, 25] Often combined with quantization (IVF-PQ).

#### Flat Index #Baseline #ExactSearch
Stores vectors directly without compression or complex structure. Provides perfect accuracy but requires exhaustive search (slow). [17, 22]
