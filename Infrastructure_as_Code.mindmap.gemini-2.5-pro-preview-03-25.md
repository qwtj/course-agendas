# Infrastructure as Code #IaC #Overview #DevOps
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure (processes, bare-metal servers, virtual servers, networks, load balancers, connection topology, etc.) through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

## Core Concepts and Fundamentals #Basics #Theory #Definition
The foundational ideas and terminology of IaC.

### What is IaC? #Definition #Introduction
Defining IaC as managing infrastructure through code and automation, moving away from manual processes.

### Goals of IaC #Objectives #Automation #Consistency
Key aims include speed, consistency, reliability, cost savings, and risk reduction in infrastructure management.

### Evolution from Traditional Infrastructure Management #History #ManualVsAutomated
Comparing IaC to older methods like manual configuration, shell scripting, and click-ops in GUIs.

## Key Principles #GuidingPrinciples #BestPractices
Core tenets that underpin effective IaC implementation.

### Idempotence #Consistency #Reliability
Ensuring that applying the same configuration multiple times results in the same system state without unintended side effects.

### Declarative vs. Imperative Approach #ProgrammingModel #Approach
Understanding the two main ways to define infrastructure configuration.
    #### Declarative (What) #DesiredState #Terraform #CloudFormation
    Focuses on defining the desired end state of the infrastructure, leaving the "how" to the tool.
    #### Imperative (How) #StepByStep #Scripts #Ansible
    Focuses on defining the specific sequence of commands needed to reach the desired state.

### Infrastructure is Version Controlled #Git #SourceControl #History #Collaboration
Treating infrastructure definition files like application code, using version control systems (like Git) for tracking changes, collaboration, and rollback.

### Infrastructure is Tested #QualityAssurance #Validation #Testing
Applying software testing practices to infrastructure code to ensure correctness, security, and reliability before deployment.

### Infrastructure is Immutable #ImmutableInfrastructure #Consistency #DeploymentStrategy
A pattern where infrastructure components (servers, containers) are never modified after deployment. Updates are made by replacing old components with new ones built from a common image/definition.

## Benefits of IaC #Advantages #ValueProposition
The positive outcomes and value derived from adopting IaC.

### Automation and Speed #Efficiency #TimeSaving
Drastically reduces the time and effort required for provisioning and managing infrastructure.

### Consistency and Standardization #Reliability #ErrorReduction
Ensures environments are created reliably and consistently, reducing configuration drift and errors.

### Version Control and Auditability #Tracking #History #Compliance
Provides a clear history of changes, facilitates audits, and enables easy rollback.

### Cost Reduction #Optimization #Efficiency
Reduces manual labor costs, minimizes errors, and allows for resource optimization.

### Scalability and Reusability #Modularity #Templates
Makes it easy to scale infrastructure up or down and reuse configurations across environments or projects.

### State Management Complexity #StateDrift #Concurrency
Managing the state file, handling drift, and dealing with concurrent operations can be challenging.

### Security Risks #SecretsManagement #Permissions
Improper handling of secrets or excessive permissions in IaC code can create security vulnerabilities.

### Testing Challenges #EnvironmentParity #IntegrationTesting
Creating effective tests for infrastructure code, especially integration tests, can be difficult.

### Potential for Large Blast Radius #ErrorImpact #RiskManagement
An error in IaC code can potentially affect a large part of the infrastructure quickly.
