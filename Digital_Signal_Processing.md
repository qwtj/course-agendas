# I. Introduction to Digital Signal Processing (DSP)

## Understanding Signals and Systems

### Defining Signals

*   Continuous-time vs. Discrete-time signals
*   Analog vs. Digital signals
*   Examples: `sin(t)`, `cos(t)`, unit step function `u[n]`
*   Signal properties: amplitude, frequency, phase

### Defining Systems

*   Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems
*   System properties: linearity, time-invariance, causality, stability
*   Examples: Moving average filter, differentiator

## Signal Representation

### Time-Domain Representation

*   Representing signals as a function of time: `x(t)` or `x[n]`
*   Examples: audio signals, stock prices

### Frequency-Domain Representation

*   Fourier Transform (FT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
*   Understanding frequency components of a signal
*   Using the DFT to analyze audio signals

# II. Discrete-Time Signals and Systems

## Sampling and Quantization

### Sampling Theorem

*   Nyquist rate: `f_s > 2f_max`
*   Aliasing: Understanding and preventing it
*   Example: Sampling a 1 kHz sine wave at 1.5 kHz and 3 kHz. Observe the aliasing effect in the first case.

### Quantization

*   Quantization levels and error
*   Uniform and non-uniform quantization
*   Signal-to-Quantization Noise Ratio (SQNR)
*   Example: Quantizing an analog signal to 4 bits and 8 bits. Observe the impact on signal quality.

## Discrete-Time System Analysis

### Convolution

*   Linear convolution of discrete-time signals
*   Convolution sum: `y[n] = Î£ x[k]h[n-k]`
*   Example: Convolving a square wave with a triangular pulse.

### Z-Transform

*   Definition and properties of the Z-transform
*   Region of Convergence (ROC)
*   Inverse Z-transform
*   Example: Find the Z-transform of `x[n] = a^n u[n]` and determine the ROC.

### Transfer Function

*   Representing systems in the Z-domain: `H(z) = Y(z)/X(z)`
*   Poles and zeros of the transfer function
*   Stability analysis using pole locations
*   Example: Analyze the stability of a system with transfer function `H(z) = 1/(1 - 0.5z^-1)`.

# III. Digital Filter Design

## Filter Types

### FIR Filters

*   Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters
*   Linear phase characteristics
*   Design methods: windowing, frequency sampling
*   Example: Design a low-pass FIR filter using the Hamming window.

### IIR Filters

*   Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters
*   Design methods: Butterworth, Chebyshev, Elliptic approximations
*   Bilinear transformation
*   Example: Design a Butterworth low-pass filter using the bilinear transform.

## Filter Design Techniques

### Windowing Method

*   Common window functions: Rectangular, Hamming, Hanning, Blackman
*   Trade-offs between main lobe width and side lobe levels
*   Example: Compare the frequency response of a filter designed using rectangular and Hamming windows.

### Frequency Sampling Method

*   Designing filters by specifying frequency samples
*   Interpolation techniques
*   Example: Design a filter by specifying the desired frequency response at several points.

### Bilinear Transformation

*   Mapping s-plane to z-plane
*   Frequency warping
*   Pre-warping technique
*   Example: Design an IIR filter with a cutoff frequency of 1 kHz using the bilinear transform.

# IV. DSP Applications

## Audio Processing

### Audio Compression

*   MP3, AAC codecs
*   Psychoacoustic models
*   Example: Analyze the frequency content of an audio file before and after MP3 compression.

### Audio Effects

*   Reverb, echo, chorus
*   Implementing effects using digital filters
*   Example: Implement a simple echo effect using a delay line.

## Image Processing

### Image Filtering

*   Smoothing, sharpening, edge detection
*   Applying 2D convolution
*   Example: Apply a Gaussian blur filter to an image.

### Image Compression

*   JPEG compression
*   Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
*   Example: Analyze the DCT coefficients of an image block.

## Communication Systems

### Modulation and Demodulation

*   Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), Phase Shift Keying (PSK)
*   Implementing modulation and demodulation using DSP techniques
*   Example: Simulate an AM communication system.

### Channel Equalization

*   Compensating for channel distortions
*   Adaptive equalization techniques
*   Example: Implement a simple equalizer to remove echo.
