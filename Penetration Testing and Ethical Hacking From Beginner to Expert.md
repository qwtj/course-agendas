# I. Foundations of Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing

## Understanding Core Concepts

### Defining Ethical Hacking
*   Purpose and Scope
*   Distinction from Malicious Hacking

### Penetration Testing Methodologies
*   Black Box, White Box, and Grey Box Testing
*   OWASP Testing Guide

### Legal and Ethical Considerations
*   Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
*   Data Privacy Regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
*   Importance of Scope and Rules of Engagement

## Setting Up a Pentesting Lab

### Virtualization Technologies
*   VirtualBox
*   VMware

### Operating Systems for Pentesting
*   Kali Linux
*   Parrot OS

### Network Configuration
*   NAT, Bridged, and Host-Only Networking Modes
*   Understanding IP Addressing and Subnetting

# II. Information Gathering and Reconnaissance

## Passive Reconnaissance

### Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
*   Using Search Engines (Google Dorks)
    ```
    site:example.com filetype:pdf
    inurl:password
    ```
*   Social Media Reconnaissance
*   WHOIS and DNS Lookups
    ```
    whois example.com
    nslookup example.com
    ```

### Identifying Technologies
*   Using `whatweb`
    ```
    whatweb example.com
    ```
*   Identifying Web Server and CMS

## Active Reconnaissance

### Network Scanning
*   Using `nmap` for host discovery and port scanning
    ```
    nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
    nmap -p 1-1000 192.168.1.100
    ```
*   Service and Version Detection
    ```
    nmap -sV 192.168.1.100
    ```
*   OS Fingerprinting

### Banner Grabbing
*   Using `netcat` for manual banner grabbing
    ```
    nc example.com 80
    HEAD / HTTP/1.0
    ```

# III. Vulnerability Analysis and Exploitation

## Web Application Vulnerabilities

### Common Web Application Vulnerabilities
*   SQL Injection (SQLi)
    ```sql
    ' OR '1'='1
    ```
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    ```html
    <script>alert('XSS')</script>
    ```
*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
*   Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
*   Command Injection

### Using Automated Vulnerability Scanners
*   Burp Suite
*   OWASP ZAP

### Manual Vulnerability Testing

## Network Vulnerabilities

### Common Network Vulnerabilities
*   Unsecured Services (e.g., FTP, Telnet)
*   Weak Credentials
*   Outdated Software

### Exploiting Network Services
*   Metasploit Framework
*   Exploit Database (exploit-db.com)

### Buffer Overflow Exploits

# IV. Post-Exploitation and Reporting

## Post-Exploitation Techniques

### Maintaining Access
*   Creating Backdoors
*   Privilege Escalation
*   Using Metasploit Meterpreter
    ```
    sessions -i 1
    ```

### Data Exfiltration
*   Identifying and Extracting Sensitive Data
*   Covering Tracks

## Report Writing

### Structure of a Penetration Test Report
*   Executive Summary
*   Scope and Methodology
*   Vulnerability Assessment
*   Exploitation
*   Recommendations
*   Conclusion

### Best Practices for Report Writing
*   Clarity and Conciseness
*   Prioritizing Findings Based on Risk
*   Providing Actionable Recommendations
