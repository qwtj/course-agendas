# Vector Database Options #Overview #Technology
An outline of different solutions for storing, indexing, and querying high-dimensional vector embeddings.

## Fundamentals of Vector Databases #Basics #Concepts
Introduction to the core ideas and purpose of vector databases.
These databases are specialized for handling vector embeddings, which are numerical representations of unstructured data (text, images, audio) generated by machine learning models. [6, 7, 15] They excel at similarity searches, finding vectors that are close to a query vector in a high-dimensional space. [4, 16, 18]

### What are Vector Embeddings? #Embeddings #Representation
Numerical representations (vectors) of data (text, images, audio, etc.) that capture semantic meaning or context. [3, 7, 15] Similar concepts have vectors close to each other in the vector space. [14, 15]

### Why Vector Databases are Needed #Need #ProblemSpace
Traditional databases struggle with efficient storage and querying of high-dimensional, unstructured data and similarity searches. [2, 4, 7] Vector databases are purpose-built for these tasks, especially crucial for AI/ML applications. [1, 5, 12]

### Vector Database vs. Traditional Database #Comparison #Differences
Traditional databases (SQL, NoSQL) manage structured or semi-structured data using exact matches. [2, 14, 15] Vector databases manage high-dimensional vectors using similarity searches. [2, 4, 14] Vector databases often complement, rather than replace, traditional ones. [2, 12]

### Vector Database vs. Vector Library/Index #Comparison #Tools
Libraries like FAISS offer indexing and search but lack full database features (data management, scalability, metadata filtering, CRUD). [1, 18] Vector databases provide a complete system with these features. [1, 6, 18]

## Core Technical Concepts #Technology #Architecture
Key technical components and principles behind vector databases.

### Vector Representation #DataModel #Vectors
Vectors are defined by dimensions (high-dimensional space) and often associated with an ID and a payload (metadata). [7] The point (ID, vector, payload) is a core unit. [7]

### Indexing #Indexing #ANN
The process of organizing vectors for efficient search. [1, 7] Crucial for performance in high-dimensional spaces. [3]
#### Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Search #ANN #Search
Algorithms that find *close* neighbors quickly, trading perfect accuracy for speed. [1, 3, 5] Essential for scalability. [1]
#### Exact Nearest Neighbor (ENN) Search #ENN #Search
Algorithms that guarantee finding the absolute closest neighbors, often computationally expensive ("flat" index). [17]

### Querying #Querying #Search
Process of finding vectors similar to a given query vector using similarity metrics. [1, 6]
#### Similarity Search (Vector Search) #SimilaritySearch #VectorSearch
Finding data points based on semantic or contextual closeness rather than exact matches. [1, 18] Enabled by vector embeddings and distance metrics. [15]
