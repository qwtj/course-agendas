## Measuring Tornado Intensity: Damage Scales
"<prompt>Explain that tornado intensity is classified *after* the event based on the damage caused. Describe the original `Fujita (F) Scale` and the updated `Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale`, emphasizing that the EF scale uses specific `Damage Indicators (DIs)` and `Degrees of Damage (DODs)` for more consistent ratings."</prompt>

### Original Fujita (F) Scale
"<prompt>Briefly describe the original Fujita Scale (F0-F5), noting its development by Dr. Tetsuya Fujita and its basis in correlating damage to estimated wind speeds. Mention its limitations, particularly subjectivity in damage assessment."</prompt>

Provide concise examples of damage typical for EF0, EF2, and EF5 ratings."</prompt>
*   **Examples:** "<prompt>Generate brief damage descriptions for EF0 (e.g., `EF0`: Loss of roof covering material (<20%), gutters, siding), EF2 (e.g., `EF2`: Roofs torn off well-constructed houses, mobile homes destroyed), and EF5 (e.g., `EF5`: Strong frame houses leveled and swept away, significant structural deformation to high-rise buildings)."</prompt>

## Tornado Life Cycle

*   **Technical Details:** "<prompt>Define `hook echo` as a radar reflectivity feature suggesting inflow into a mesocyclone, and `TVS` as a small-scale area of strong inbound and outbound velocities close together, indicating intense rotation."</prompt>

### Storm Spotter Networks
"<prompt>Explain the critical role of trained volunteer `storm spotters` (e.g., `SKYWARN` network in the US) and reports from the public and emergency responders in providing real-time, ground-truth observations of tornadoes, funnel clouds, and significant storm features (like wall clouds) that radar may not resolve."</prompt>

## Tornado Forecasting Process
"<prompt>Describe the multi-stage process of tornado forecasting, starting with identifying favorable large-scale atmospheric patterns days in advance, progressing to issuing regional severe weather outlooks hours ahead, and culminating in storm-specific warnings."</prompt>

### Convective Outlooks (Storm Prediction Center - SPC)

Describe their `Convective Outlook` products, which categorize the risk of severe thunderstorms (including tornadoes) over broad areas using terms like `Marginal`, `Slight`, `Enhanced`, `Moderate`, and `High` risk, valid for different time periods."</prompt>

### Mesoscale Discussions (MDs)

## Tornado Watches vs. Warnings
"<prompt>Clearly differentiate between a `Tornado Watch` and a `Tornado Warning`. Explain that a Watch means conditions are favorable for tornadoes to develop in and near the watch area, while a Warning means a tornado has been sighted by spotters or indicated by radar, posing an imminent threat to life and property within the specified warning polygon."</prompt>
