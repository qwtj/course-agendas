# Scrum #Agile #Framework
Scrum is a lightweight framework designed to help teams, individuals, and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. It is founded on empiricism and lean thinking.

## Scrum Theory #Fundamentals #Empiricism #LeanThinking
Underpins the entire Scrum framework, emphasizing learning through experience and adapting based on what is observed.
### Empiricism #Observation #Experience
Asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.
#### Transparency #Visibility #Openness
Key information about the process and work must be visible to those responsible for the outcomes. Artifacts like backlogs and increments promote transparency.
#### Inspection #Review #Assessment
Scrum artifacts and progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect undesirable variances or problems. Events like Sprint Review and Daily Scrum facilitate inspection.
#### Adaptation #Adjustment #Improvement
If inspection reveals aspects deviating outside acceptable limits, the process or the material being produced must be adjusted as soon as possible to minimize further deviation. Events like Sprint Retrospective and Sprint Planning facilitate adaptation.
### Lean Thinking #Efficiency #ValueStream
Focuses on reducing waste and focusing on essentials to improve efficiency and value delivery.

## Scrum Values #Principles #Culture #Mindset
These values guide the Scrum Team's work, actions, and behavior, creating an environment of trust and collaboration.
### Commitment #Dedication #Goals
Team members personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team.
### Courage #Bravery #Honesty
The team needs courage to do the right thing, work on tough problems, be open about challenges, and question the status quo.
### Focus #Concentration #SprintGoal
Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team, limiting distractions.
### Openness #Transparency #Candor
The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges encountered.
### Respect #Collaboration #Professionalism
Team members respect each other as capable, independent individuals with diverse skills and experiences.

## Scrum Roles (Accountabilities) #Team #Responsibilities #Structure
Scrum defines three specific accountabilities within the Scrum Team. The team is self-organizing and cross-functional.
### Product Owner #Value #Prioritization #Vision
Accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. Manages the Product Backlog effectively.
#### Responsibilities #BacklogManagement #StakeholderLiaison
Developing and communicating the Product Goal; Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items; Ordering Product Backlog items; Ensuring the Product Backlog is transparent, visible, and understood.
### Scrum Master #Facilitator #Coach #ServantLeader
Accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. Helps everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization.
#### Responsibilities #ImpedimentRemoval #ProcessImprovement #Coaching
Coaching team members in self-management and cross-functionality; Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done; Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Teamâ€™s progress; Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox.
#### Service To Product Owner #Techniques #ValueMaximization
Finding techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management; Helping establish empirical product planning.
#### Service To Organization #Adoption #ChangeAgent

### Developers #Delivery #Execution #CrossFunctional
The people in the Scrum Team committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.
#### Responsibilities #SprintBacklog #Quality #IncrementCreation
Creating a plan for the Sprint (the Sprint Backlog); Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done; Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; Holding each other accountable as professionals.
#### Team Size #Collaboration #Efficiency
Typically 10 or fewer people. Small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint.

## Scrum Events #Meetings #Cadence #Timebox
Prescribed events used in Scrum to create regularity and minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum. All events are timeboxed.
### The Sprint #Iteration #Cycle #Container
A timebox of one month or less during which a "Done," usable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints provide consistency.
#### Sprint Goal #Objective #Focus
A single objective for the Sprint. It provides focus and guidance to the Developers on why they are building the Increment.
#### Timebox #Duration #Consistency
Fixed length events, typically 1-4 weeks. Cannot be shortened or lengthened once started.
### Sprint Planning #Plan #Forecast #Collaboration
Initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed. The Scrum Team collaborates to define a Sprint Goal and select Product Backlog items for the Sprint.
#### Topic One: Why is this Sprint valuable? #Value #SprintGoal
The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. The whole Scrum Team collaborates to define a Sprint Goal.
#### Topic Two: What can be Done this Sprint? #Selection #Capacity
Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint.
#### Topic Three: How will the chosen work get done? #Plan #Tasks
Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done. Work is decomposed into smaller items (e.g., tasks).
### Daily Scrum #Standup #Coordination #Inspection
A 15-minute event for the Developers to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary. Improves communication, identifies impediments, and promotes quick decision-making.
#### Purpose #Synchronization #Adaptation
Inspect progress, adapt the plan for the next 24 hours.
#### Format #Questions #Discussion
Format varies, but often focuses on progress towards the Sprint Goal and any impediments.
### Sprint Review #Demo #Feedback #Inspection
Held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders, and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.
#### Purpose #InspectIncrement #GatherFeedback
Demonstrate completed work, get feedback from stakeholders.
#### Attendees #ScrumTeam #Stakeholders
Includes the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner.
#### Outcome #AdaptedBacklog #FuturePlanning
Feedback may result in adjustments to the Product Backlog. Input for the next Sprint Planning.
### Sprint Retrospective #Improvement #Reflection #Process
Occurs after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning. An opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.
#### Purpose #InspectProcess #IdentifyImprovements
Discuss what went well, what problems occurred, and how those problems could be prevented or solved.
#### Format #Techniques #ActionPlan
Various facilitation techniques can be used. The outcome is actionable improvement items for the next Sprint.

## Scrum Artifacts #Transparency #Work #Value
Represent work or value. They are designed to maximize the transparency of key information. Each artifact contains a commitment.
### Product Backlog #Requirements #Features #PrioritizedList
An emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.
#### Commitment: Product Goal #Vision #LongTermObjective
Describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against.
#### Refinement #Grooming #Elaboration
The act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. An ongoing activity.
### Sprint Backlog #Plan #Tasks #CurrentWork
Composed of the Sprint Goal (the why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (the what), plus an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (the how).
#### Commitment: Sprint Goal #Focus #Objective
The single objective for the Sprint. Created during Sprint Planning.
#### Emergence #Adaptation #DailyUpdate
The Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned. Managed by the Developers.
### Increment #Deliverable #Value #DoneWork
A concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint.
#### Commitment: Definition of Done #Quality #Standard
A formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product. Ensures everyone understands what "Done" means.

## Definition of Done (DoD) #Quality #Standard #Agreement
A formal description used by the Scrum Team to assess when work is complete on the product Increment. Creates transparency and is used to ensure quality.
### Purpose #Transparency #QualityAssurance
Provides a shared understanding of what quality standards the Increment must meet.
### Creation & Ownership #TeamAgreement #Collaboration
If not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a DoD appropriate for the product.
### Relation to Increment #QualityCheck #ReleaseReadiness
Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.
