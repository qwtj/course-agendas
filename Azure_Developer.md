# I. Foundational Azure Concepts

## Understanding Cloud Computing Principles

### Defining Cloud Computing
*   On-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user.

### Cloud Service Models
*   **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Computing infrastructure managed for you, on-demand. Example: Azure Virtual Machines.
*   **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Platform for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications. Example: Azure App Service.
*   **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Software applications delivered over the Internet, on-demand. Example: Office 365.

### Azure Core Services
*   Compute, storage, networking, databases.

## Introduction to Azure Portal and CLI

### Navigating the Azure Portal
*   Understanding resource groups, subscriptions, and regions.

### Using Azure CLI
*   Installing and configuring Azure CLI.
*   Basic commands: `az login`, `az group create`, `az vm create`.
```bash
    az login
    az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
    az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM --image UbuntuLTS --admin-username azureuser --generate-ssh-keys
```

# II. Core Development Skills

## Working with Azure Compute Services

### Creating and Managing Virtual Machines
*   Choosing the right VM size and image.
*   Configuring networking and storage.
*   Connecting to a VM via SSH or RDP.

### Understanding Azure App Service
*   Deploying web applications to App Service.
*   Configuring deployment slots for testing.
*   Scaling App Service plans.
*   Example deployment using `az webapp up`.

### Azure Functions
*   Creating serverless functions.
*   Understanding triggers and bindings (HTTP, Timer, Blob Storage).
*   Developing functions using different languages (C#, JavaScript, Python).

## Managing Azure Storage

### Azure Blob Storage
*   Understanding blob types (Block, Append, Page).
*   Uploading and downloading blobs using Azure CLI or SDKs.
*   Configuring access tiers (Hot, Cool, Archive).

### Azure Queue Storage
*   Working with queues for asynchronous messaging.
*   Enqueuing and dequeuing messages.

### Azure Table Storage
*   Storing structured data in NoSQL tables.
*   Querying tables using OData.

## Implementing Security and Identity

### Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
*   Understanding users, groups, and roles.
*   Implementing authentication and authorization.

### Managed Identities
*   Using managed identities to securely access Azure resources from VMs or App Services.

### Azure Key Vault
*   Storing and managing secrets, keys, and certificates.

# III. Advanced Development Topics

## Building Scalable Applications

### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
*   Deploying and managing containerized applications.
*   Understanding Kubernetes concepts (Pods, Deployments, Services).

### Azure Service Bus
*   Implementing advanced messaging patterns (Queues, Topics, Subscriptions).

### Azure Event Hubs
*   Ingesting and processing large streams of data.

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Azure Monitor
*   Collecting and analyzing logs and metrics.
*   Creating alerts and dashboards.

### Application Insights
*   Monitoring application performance and availability.
*   Troubleshooting issues using telemetry data.

## Automating Deployments

### Azure DevOps
*   Setting up continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
*   Using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to automate infrastructure deployments.
*   Example: Create a pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys an app service.
```yaml
# azure-pipelines.yml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- script: echo "Hello, world!"
  displayName: 'Run a script'
```

# IV. Working with Data

## Azure Cosmos DB
### Understanding Cosmos DB APIs
*   SQL (Core) API, MongoDB API, Cassandra API, Gremlin API, Table API.
### Creating and Querying Data
*   Creating databases and containers.
*   Writing and executing queries.
### Data Modeling and Partitioning
*   Choosing the right partition key.
*   Optimizing queries for performance.

## Azure SQL Database

### Deploying and Managing SQL Database
*   Choosing the right service tier.
*   Configuring security and networking.

### Writing SQL Queries

### Data Migration Strategies

# V. Specialized Services

## Azure Cognitive Services

### Computer Vision
*   Analyzing images and videos.
### Natural Language Processing
