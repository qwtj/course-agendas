## Core Kafka Concepts Relevant to MSK #KafkaConcepts #Fundamentals
*   Producers: Applications publishing data to topics. [1]
*   Consumers: Applications reading/processing data from topics. [1]
*   Topics: Categories or feeds for organizing records. [1]
*   Partitions: Subdivisions of topics for parallelism and scalability. [1, 5]
*   Brokers: Servers (nodes) that form the Kafka cluster, store data. [1, 5, 8, 10, 25]
*   ZooKeeper/KRaft: Coordination service (ZooKeeper managed by MSK, KRaft optional). [7, 8, 10, 24]
*   Offsets: Position of a consumer within a partition.
*   Consumer Groups: Coordinate consumers reading from topics.

## Comparison: MSK vs. Alternatives #Comparison #Alternatives
*   MSK vs. Self-Managed Kafka on EC2: [1, 14, 17]
    *   Management Overhead: MSK lower, Self-managed higher. [1, 7, 14, 17]
    *   Control: MSK less, Self-managed full control. [1, 9, 17]
    *   Cost: MSK potentially lower TCO due to reduced ops, but depends on usage; Self-managed requires infra cost + ops cost. [1, 7, 17]
    *   Integration: MSK seamless AWS integration. [1, 17]
    *   Expertise: MSK requires less Kafka ops expertise. [1, 7, 17]
*   MSK vs. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams: [18, 23]
    *   API: MSK uses Kafka API, Kinesis uses Kinesis API.
    *   Management: MSK (Provisioned) requires some capacity mgmt, Kinesis is fully serverless. MSK Serverless is also serverless. [23]
    *   Ecosystem: MSK leverages broad Kafka ecosystem. [23]
    *   Complexity: Kinesis often simpler for basic streaming use cases. [23]
*   MSK vs. Amazon SQS: [18]
    *   Type: MSK is a streaming platform, SQS is a message queue.
    *   Use Case: MSK for high-throughput streaming/log aggregation/event sourcing; SQS for decoupling, task queues. [18]
    *   Ordering: MSK provides ordering within a partition; SQS Standard offers best-effort, SQS FIFO offers strict ordering.
    *   Retention: MSK designed for longer retention (potentially via Tiered Storage); SQS has limited retention (max 14 days).

## Troubleshooting #Debugging #Issues
*   Common Issues:
    *   Client Connection Problems (Security Groups, Authentication, Bootstrap Servers). [9]
    *   Performance Bottlenecks (CPU, Memory, Network, Disk).
    *   High Consumer Lag.
    *   Storage Full (Provisioned). [16]
    *   Broker Failures (MSK handles automatically, but monitor). [8, 10]
*   Troubleshooting Tools:
    *   CloudWatch Metrics and Logs. [5, 16]
    *   AWS Health Dashboard (Service health, storage alerts). [16]
    *   Kafka command-line tools (run from a client machine).
    *   Reviewing Cluster Configuration and Client Settings.
