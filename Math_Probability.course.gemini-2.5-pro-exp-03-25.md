# I. Foundations of Probability

*   **Learning Objectives:** Define fundamental probability terms, differentiate types of probability, and apply basic probability rules.
*   **Difficulty Level:** Beginner

## Understanding Basic Terminology
"<prompt>Define the core concepts in probability: 'experiment', 'outcome', 'sample space', and 'event'. Provide illustrative examples for each using simple scenarios like flipping a coin or rolling a die."

### Defining Sample Spaces
"<prompt>Explain how to construct the 'sample space' for a given random experiment. Provide examples for a single coin flip, two coin flips, and rolling a six-sided die."
*   `Experiment`: Coin Flip; `Sample Space (S)`: {Heads, Tails}
*   `Experiment`: Rolling a Die; `Sample Space (S)`: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

### Identifying Events
"<prompt>Explain what constitutes an 'event' in probability as a subset of the sample space. Give examples of simple and compound events for rolling a die (e.g., rolling a 4, rolling an even number)."
*   `Event A`: Rolling an even number = {2, 4, 6} (Subset of S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6})

## Types of Probability
"<prompt>Describe the three main approaches to defining probability: Classical (Theoretical), Empirical (Experimental/Frequentist), and Subjective. Explain the basis and typical application scenarios for each type."

### Classical Probability
"<prompt>Explain the formula for classical probability (P(E) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes) and the condition that all outcomes must be equally likely. Calculate the classical probability of drawing an Ace from a standard 52-card deck."

### Empirical Probability
"<prompt>Define empirical probability based on observed frequencies from experiments or historical data. Explain the formula P(E) ≈ (Number of times event E occurred) / (Total number of trials). Provide an example, like estimating the probability of a biased coin landing heads based on 100 flips."

### Subjective Probability
"<prompt>Describe subjective probability as a measure of personal belief or confidence in an outcome occurring, often used when classical or empirical probabilities cannot be determined. Give examples like predicting the winner of a sports match or the success of a new business venture."

## Basic Probability Rules
"<prompt>Introduce the fundamental rules governing probabilities: the range of probability values (0 to 1), the probability of the sample space (P(S)=1), and the complement rule (P(A') = 1 - P(A))."

### The Complement Rule
"<prompt>Explain the Complement Rule (P(A') = 1 - P(A)) with an example. For instance, if the probability of rain is 0.3, what is the probability of no rain?"

### Union of Events (Addition Rule)
"<prompt>Explain the Addition Rule for the union of two events: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B). Define mutually exclusive events and show how the rule simplifies for them (P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)). Provide examples for both cases using dice rolls or card draws."
*   Example (Mutually Exclusive): Probability of rolling a 2 or a 5 on a single die roll.
*   Example (Non-Mutually Exclusive): Probability of drawing a King or a Heart from a deck.

> **Key Point:** Remember to subtract the probability of the intersection P(A ∩ B) for non-mutually exclusive events to avoid double-counting.

*   **Glossary Terms:** `Experiment`, `Outcome`, `Sample Space`, `Event`, `Classical Probability`, `Empirical Probability`, `Subjective Probability`, `Complement Rule`, `Union`, `Intersection`, `Mutually Exclusive Events`. [Link to Full Glossary](#glossary)
*   **Quiz:** [Quiz Link Placeholder - Questions on basic definitions, types of probability, and complement rule]
*   **Reflection Prompt:** "Consider a real-life situation where you intuitively used probability. Which type (classical, empirical, subjective) best describes your reasoning? Why?"
*   **Section Summary:** This section introduced the foundational vocabulary of probability theory, different ways to assign probabilities, and the essential rules governing them, including the complement and addition rules.
*   **Section Transition:** Now that we understand basic probability concepts, we need methods to count the number of possible outcomes, especially in more complex scenarios. The next section covers combinatorics.

# II. Combinatorics: Counting Techniques

*   **Learning Objectives:** Understand and apply fundamental counting principles, permutations, and combinations to determine the number of possible outcomes.
*   **Difficulty Level:** Beginner/Intermediate

## The Fundamental Counting Principle
"<prompt>Explain the Fundamental Counting Principle (Multiplication Principle). If an event can occur in 'm' ways and another independent event can occur in 'n' ways, then the two events can occur in sequence in m*n ways. Provide examples like choosing outfits or creating license plates."

## Permutations
"<prompt>Define 'permutation' as an arrangement of objects in a specific order. Explain the formula for permutations of 'n' objects taken 'r' at a time: P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!. Emphasize that order matters."

### Calculating Permutations
"<prompt>Provide step-by-step examples for calculating permutations. Example 1: How many ways can 3 runners finish in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place out of 5 runners? Example 2: How many distinct ways can the letters of the word 'MATH' be arranged?"
*   `P(5, 3) = 5! / (5-3)! = 5! / 2! = 120`
*   `P(4, 4) = 4! / (4-4)! = 4! / 0! = 24` (Note: `0! = 1`)

## Combinations
"<prompt>Define 'combination' as a selection of objects where the order does not matter. Explain the formula for combinations of 'n' objects taken 'r' at a time: C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!). Emphasize that order does *not* matter."

### Calculating Combinations
"<prompt>Provide step-by-step examples for calculating combinations. Example 1: How many ways can a committee of 3 people be chosen from a group of 5 people? Example 2: How many different 5-card poker hands can be dealt from a standard 52-card deck?"
*   `C(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)! ) = 5! / (3! * 2!) = 10`
*   `C(52, 5) = 52! / (5! * 47!) = 2,598,960`

## Applying Counting to Probability
"<prompt>Explain how to use permutations and combinations to calculate classical probabilities by determining the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of outcomes in the sample space. Provide an example, like the probability of drawing a specific type of poker hand."

### Example: Probability of a Flush
"<prompt>Calculate the probability of being dealt a flush (5 cards of the same suit) in a standard 5-card poker hand. Clearly define the steps: 1. Calculate total possible hands (using combinations). 2. Calculate the number of ways to get a flush (choose suit, choose 5 cards from that suit). 3. Divide favorable outcomes by total outcomes."

*   **Glossary Terms:** `Fundamental Counting Principle`, `Permutation`, `Combination`, `Factorial`. [Link to Full Glossary](#glossary)
*   **Cross-reference:** These counting techniques are essential for calculating probabilities in Section I, especially when dealing with equally likely outcomes in large sample spaces.
*   **Quiz:** [Quiz Link Placeholder - Questions involving calculating permutations, combinations, and applying them to simple probability problems.]
*   **Reflection Prompt:** "Think of a scenario (like selecting lottery numbers or forming a team) where you need to decide between using permutations or combinations. What factor determines the correct choice?"
*   **Section Summary:** This section covered essential counting techniques – the Fundamental Counting Principle, Permutations (order matters), and Combinations (order doesn't matter) – crucial for determining the size of sample spaces and event sets in probability calculations.
*   **Section Transition:** With counting methods established, we can now explore relationships between events, specifically how the occurrence of one event affects the probability of another. This leads to conditional probability.

# III. Conditional Probability and Independence

*   **Learning Objectives:** Define and calculate conditional probability, understand and apply Bayes' Theorem, and distinguish between independent and dependent events.
*   **Difficulty Level:** Intermediate

## Understanding Conditional Probability
"<prompt>Define 'conditional probability' as the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. Introduce the notation P(A|B) and the formula: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), assuming P(B) > 0."

### Calculating Conditional Probability
"<prompt>Provide examples for calculating conditional probability. Example 1: Drawing two cards from a deck without replacement, find the probability the second card is a King given the first was a King. Example 2: Use a contingency table (e.g., survey data on smoking and lung disease) to calculate conditional probabilities like P(Lung Disease | Smoker)."

```markdown
|             | Lung Disease | No Lung Disease | Total |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| Smoker      | 90           | 60              | 150   |
| Non-Smoker  | 10           | 140             | 150   |
| Total       | 100          | 200             | 300   |
```
"<prompt>Using the contingency table above, calculate P(Lung Disease | Smoker)."
*   `P(Lung Disease ∩ Smoker) = 90/300`
*   `P(Smoker) = 150/300`
*   `P(Lung Disease | Smoker) = (90/300) / (150/300) = 90/150 = 0.6`

## Bayes' Theorem
"<prompt>Introduce Bayes' Theorem as a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. State the formula: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B). Explain each term (prior probability, likelihood, evidence, posterior probability)."

### Applying Bayes' Theorem
"<prompt>Work through a classic example applying Bayes' Theorem, such as a medical diagnostic test. Given the prevalence of a disease (prior probability), the test's sensitivity (P(Positive Test | Disease)), and specificity (P(Negative Test | No Disease)), calculate the probability a patient actually has the disease given a positive test result (posterior probability)."
*   **Further Reading:** [Link Placeholder - Detailed article or tutorial on Bayes' Theorem applications]

> **Key Point:** Bayes' Theorem is fundamental in fields like machine learning (Bayesian inference), medical diagnosis, and spam filtering for updating beliefs based on observed data.

## Independence and Dependence
"<prompt>Define 'independent events' where the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other. State the condition for independence: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B), or equivalently P(A|B) = P(A) and P(B|A) = P(B). Define 'dependent events' as events that are not independent."

### Determining Independence
"<prompt>Provide examples and methods to check if two events are independent. Example 1: Rolling a die twice - are the outcomes independent? Example 2: Drawing two cards *with* replacement vs. *without* replacement - analyze independence in both scenarios. Use the independence formula P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) to verify."

*   **Glossary Terms:** `Conditional Probability`, `Bayes' Theorem`, `Prior Probability`, `Posterior Probability`, `Likelihood`, `Independent Events`, `Dependent Events`. [Link to Full Glossary](#glossary)
*   **Cross-reference:** Conditional probability builds directly on the concepts of intersection (Section I) and is crucial for understanding many real-world probabilistic models discussed later (e.g., Markov Chains in Section V).
*   **Quiz:** [Quiz Link Placeholder - Problems on calculating conditional probabilities, applying Bayes' Theorem, and identifying independent/dependent events.]
*   **Reflection Prompt:** "Describe a situation where assuming independence between two events would lead to an incorrect conclusion. Why is dependence important to consider in that case?"
*   **Section Summary:** This section explored the relationship between events, introducing conditional probability (P(A|B)), the powerful Bayes' Theorem for updating probabilities, and the critical distinction between independent and dependent events.
*   **Section Transition:** We've dealt with specific events. Now, let's generalize by introducing the concept of random variables, which assign numerical values to outcomes, and their associated probability distributions.

*   **Learning Objectives:** Define discrete and continuous random variables, understand common probability distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Normal, Exponential), and calculate expected value and variance.
*   **Difficulty Level:** Intermediate/Advanced

## Understanding Random Variables
"<prompt>Define 'random variable' as a variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon. Distinguish between 'discrete random variables' (countable values) and 'continuous random variables' (uncountable values within a range)."

### Discrete Random Variables
"<prompt>Explain discrete random variables using examples like the number of heads in three coin flips, or the number of defective items in a sample. Introduce the concept of a Probability Mass Function (PMF), p(x) = P(X=x)."

### Continuous Random Variables
"<prompt>Explain continuous random variables using examples like height, weight, or temperature. Introduce the concept of a Probability Density Function (PDF), f(x), where probability is represented by the area under the curve over an interval: P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = ∫[a to b] f(x) dx."

Introduce the standard normal distribution N(0, 1) and the use of Z-scores for calculating probabilities using standard tables or software."
*   `Z = (X - μ) / σ`

### Exponential Distribution
"<prompt>Describe the Exponential distribution Exp(λ) often used to model the time until an event occurs in a Poisson process (e.g., time between customer arrivals, lifetime of a device). Provide the PDF formula: f(x; λ) = λ * e^(-λx) for x ≥ 0."

## Expected Value and Variance
"<prompt>Define 'Expected Value' E[X] as the long-run average value of a random variable (mean). Define 'Variance' Var(X) and 'Standard Deviation' σ as measures of the spread or dispersion of a random variable around its mean."

### Calculating E[X] and Var(X)
"<prompt>Provide the formulas for calculating Expected Value and Variance for both discrete and continuous random variables. Work through examples for a simple discrete distribution (like a die roll) and mention how to find these values for standard distributions like Binomial and Normal."
*   Discrete: `E[X] = Σ [x * P(X=x)]`, `Var(X) = E[(X - E[X])²] = E[X²] - (E[X])²`
*   Continuous: `E[X] = ∫ [-inf to +inf] x * f(x) dx`, `Var(X) = ∫ [-inf to +inf] (x - E[X])² * f(x) dx`

> **Key Point:** Probability distributions provide mathematical models for random phenomena, allowing us to predict the likelihood of different outcomes and understand their variability.

[Link to Full Glossary](#glossary)

## The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
"<prompt>Explain the Central Limit Theorem. State that the distribution of the sample mean (or sum) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a Normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution's shape. Discuss its profound importance in statistics for inference and approximation."

### Applying the CLT
"<prompt>Provide an example scenario where the Central Limit Theorem is applied. For instance, approximating the distribution of the average weight of 100 randomly selected apples, even if the individual apple weights are not normally distributed. Show how to use the theorem to calculate probabilities related to the sample mean."
*   If `X₁, ..., Xn` are i.i.d with mean `μ` and variance `σ²`, then for large `n`, the sample mean `X̄` is approximately `N(μ, σ²/n)`.

> **Key Point:** The CLT is arguably the most important theorem in probability and statistics, allowing us to use the Normal distribution for inference even when the underlying population distribution is unknown.

## Introduction to Markov Chains (Optional)

Define key terms like 'state', 'transition probability', and 'state transition matrix'. Give simple examples like a basic weather model (Sunny/Rainy) or a random walk."

*   **Section Summary:** This final section covered two cornerstone theorems: the Law of Large Numbers (long-run averages converge to expected values) and the Central Limit Theorem (sample means tend towards a Normal distribution). A brief introduction to Markov Chains and other advanced topics was also provided as potential next steps.
