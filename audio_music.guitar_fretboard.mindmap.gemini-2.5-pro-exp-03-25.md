# Guitar Fretboard #Overview #GuitarAnatomy

The guitar fretboard (or fingerboard) is the surface on the neck of a guitar where the player presses down the strings to change the vibrating length, thus altering the pitch. Understanding it is fundamental to playing the guitar.

## Anatomy and Construction #Hardware #Materials #Design
The physical components and design characteristics of the fretboard.

### Frets #Metal #PitchControl

#### Fret Material #NickelSilver #StainlessSteel #EvoGold
Common alloys used for frets, affecting feel and durability.
#### Fret Size #Jumbo #Medium #NarrowTall
Dimensions of the frets (height and width), impacting playability and feel.
#### Fret Count #Vintage #Modern #ExtendedRange
Typically 21, 22, or 24 frets, affecting the guitar's highest playable note.
