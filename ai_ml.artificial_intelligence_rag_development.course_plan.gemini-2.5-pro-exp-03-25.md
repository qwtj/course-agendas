### What is RAG?
"<prompt>Define Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) clearly.

### Why RAG? Motivation & Benefits
"<prompt>Elaborate on the motivations for using RAG. Discuss the key limitations of standard LLMs that RAG aims to address, such as knowledge being frozen at training time (knowledge cutoff), susceptibility to generating plausible but incorrect information (hallucinations), lack of domain-specific knowledge, and difficulties in tracing information sources (transparency). Highlight the benefits RAG offers in overcoming these challenges. Start the next section with a level 3 heading (###).</prompt>"

### Core Components Overview
"<prompt>Provide a high-level overview of the essential components in a typical RAG pipeline. Describe the role of the 'Retriever' (finding relevant context) and the 'Generator' (synthesizing an answer using the context). Illustrate the basic data flow: User Query -> Retriever -> Retrieved Context -> Generator -> Final Answer. Start the next section with a level 3 heading (###).</prompt>"

### RAG vs. Fine-tuning vs. Standard LLMs
"<prompt>Compare and contrast RAG with two other common approaches for leveraging LLMs: fine-tuning and using standard (pre-trained) LLMs directly. Discuss the key differences in how each approach incorporates knowledge, the types of tasks they are best suited for, implementation complexity, maintenance effort (especially regarding knowledge updates), and potential costs.
