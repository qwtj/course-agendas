#### Deck Shapes and Sizes #Shape #Size #Concave
Varying shapes (popsicle, shaped, cruiser), widths, lengths, and concavity affect performance.
#### Grip Tape #Grip #Traction
Sandpaper-like material applied to the top surface for foot grip.
### Trucks #Axles #Turning
Metal T-shaped components mounted underneath the deck that house the wheels and allow turning.
#### Truck Components (Baseplate, Hanger, Kingpin, Bushings) #Parts #Mechanism

#### Truck Width and Height #Sizing #Performance
Matching truck width to deck width and choosing height (low, mid, high) impacts stability and wheel bite.
### Wheels #Rolling #Contact
