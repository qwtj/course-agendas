# Data Warehousing #Overview #Fundamentals #BI
Centralized repository of integrated data from disparate sources, structured for query and analysis.

## Introduction and Core Concepts #Basics #Definitions #Purpose
Understanding the foundational ideas behind data warehousing.

### What is a Data Warehouse? #Definition #Concept
A system used for reporting and data analysis, considered a core component of business intelligence.

### Goals of Data Warehousing #Objectives #Benefits
Primary aims like decision support, data consistency, historical intelligence, and improved performance for analytical queries.

### Key Characteristics (Bill Inmon) #Properties #Inmon
#### Subject-Oriented #Focus #Domain
Data organized around major subjects (e.g., Customer, Product, Sales).
#### Integrated #Consistency #UnifiedView
Data from various sources made consistent (naming conventions, formats, units).
#### Time-Variant #Historical #Temporal
Data represents snapshots over time, enabling historical analysis and trend tracking.
#### Non-Volatile #Stable #ReadOnly
Data is typically read-only; updates are loaded regularly but transactions aren't processed in real-time like OLTP.

### Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) vs Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) #Comparison #Systems
#### OLTP Systems #Transactional #Operational
Focus on transaction processing, high throughput, real-time data, normalized. (e.g., ERP, CRM)
#### OLAP Systems #Analytical #Reporting
Focus on complex queries, analysis, historical data, often denormalized. (e.g., Data Warehouses)

### Benefits of Data Warehousing #Advantages #Value
Improved decision-making, enhanced data quality, consolidated view, historical analysis capabilities, better BI performance.

### History and Evolution #Timeline #Development
From early decision support systems to modern cloud data warehouses.

## Data Warehouse Architecture #Design #Structure #Models
Blueprints and structural models for building and organizing a data warehouse.

### Core Components #BuildingBlocks #Elements
#### Data Sources #Input #Systems
Operational databases, ERP/CRM systems, flat files, logs, external data feeds.
#### Staging Area #ETLZone #TemporaryStorage
Intermediate storage used during the ETL/ELT process for cleaning and transforming data before loading into the warehouse.
#### Data Warehouse Repository #CoreStorage #Database
The central database where integrated and cleaned data is stored.
#### Data Marts #Subsets #Departmental
Smaller, focused data warehouses often derived from the central DWH, tailored for specific business lines or departments (e.g., Sales Mart, Marketing Mart).
#### Metadata Repository #DataDictionary #Context
Stores information about the data warehouse data (definitions, sources, transformations, structures).
#### Data Access and Analysis Tools #Frontend #BI Tools
Tools used by end-users to query, analyze, and report on data (e.g., BI platforms, SQL clients, spreadsheets).

### Architectural Approaches #Paradigms #Methodologies
#### Centralized Data Warehouse (Inmon - Top-Down) #EDW #CIF
Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) built first, then data marts are derived. Emphasizes integration.
#### Dimensional Data Marts (Kimball - Bottom-Up) #BusArchitecture #Dimensional
Building independent or conformed data marts first, which collectively form the enterprise warehouse. Emphasizes usability and speed.
#### Hybrid Approaches #Combined #Flexible
Combining elements of both Inmon and Kimball methodologies.
#### Federated Data Warehouse #Distributed #Virtual

##### Types of Facts #FactCategories
###### Additive Facts #Summable
Facts that can be summed across any dimension (e.g., Sales Quantity, Sales Amount).
###### Semi-Additive Facts #LimitedSummation
Facts that can be summed across some dimensions but not others (e.g., Account Balance - additive over time, not across accounts).
###### Non-Additive Facts #Ratios #Percentages
Facts that cannot be summed across any dimension (e.g., Unit Price, Temperature).
##### Fact Table Granularity #LevelOfDetail #Grain
The level of detail represented by a single row in the fact table (e.g., daily sales per product per store).
##### Factless Fact Tables #Events #Relationships
Fact tables that contain no measures, used to model events or relationships between dimensions.

#### Dimensions and Dimension Tables #Context #Attributes #Descriptors
Tables containing descriptive attributes about the facts (e.g., Customer details, Product information, Time periods).
##### Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs) #HistoricalTracking #AttributeChanges
Techniques for managing changes in dimension attributes over time.
###### Type 0: Retain Original #Fixed #Static
Attribute value never changes.
###### Type 1: Overwrite #NoHistory #UpdateInPlace
Overwrite the old attribute value with the new one; no history is kept.
###### Type 2: Add New Row #History #EffectiveDates
Add a new row for the changed attribute with effective dates/flags; preserves history.
###### Type 3: Add New Attribute #LimitedHistory #PreviousValue
Add a new column to store the previous attribute value; limited history.
###### Type 4: History Table #SeparateTable #AuditTrail
Keep current data in the main dimension table and track history in a separate table.
###### Type 6: Hybrid (1+2+3) #CombinedTechnique
Combines Type 1, 2, and 3 techniques.
##### Degenerate Dimensions #FactAttributes #NoDimensionTable
Dimension attributes (like Order Number) stored directly in the fact table without a separate dimension table.
##### Role-Playing Dimensions #MultipleContexts #Aliases
A single physical dimension (e.g., Date) used multiple times in a fact table with different roles (e.g., Order Date, Ship Date).
##### Junk Dimensions #Miscellaneous #FlagsIndicators
Combines low-cardinality flags and indicators into a single dimension table to reduce the number of dimensions.
##### Conformed Dimensions #Shared #Consistent
Dimensions shared across multiple fact tables or data marts, ensuring consistency.

#### Schema Types in Dimensional Modeling #StructureTypes #StarSnowflake
##### Star Schema #Simple #Denormalized
A central fact table connected directly to multiple dimension tables. Optimized for query performance.
