# Advanced Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search #ANN #ANNS #SimilaritySearch
An overview of Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), a technique for finding points in high-dimensional spaces that are close to a given query point, prioritizing speed over absolute accuracy. Essential for large datasets where exact search is computationally infeasible.

## Introduction and Fundamentals #Basics #ProblemDefinition #Motivation
Defines the Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) problem and the need for approximation, especially in high-dimensional spaces due to the curse of dimensionality. Contrasts exact NNS with ANNS.

### Problem Definition #NNS #HighDimensionality
Formal definition of the nearest neighbor search problem: Given a set S of points in a space M and a query point q, find the point p in S closest to q according to a distance metric.

### Curse of Dimensionality #Challenge #Theory
Explains how traditional indexing structures and exact search methods become inefficient as the number of dimensions increases, making distances less meaningful and search spaces vast.

### Exact vs. Approximate Search #Comparison #Tradeoff
Compares exact methods (like brute-force linear scan) which guarantee finding the true nearest neighbor but are slow, with approximate methods that sacrifice guaranteed accuracy for significant speed improvements.

### Key Concepts #Vectors #Embeddings #DistanceMetrics
Introduction to representing data (images, text, etc.) as high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) and the importance of choosing appropriate distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean, Cosine, Manhattan, Hamming, Jaccard) to measure similarity or closeness.

#### Vector Quantization (VQ) #Codebooks #Centroids
Basic principle of representing vectors by codes corresponding to the nearest centroid in a pre-computed codebook.
#### Product Quantization (PQ) #Subvectors #CartesianProduct
Splitting vectors into sub-vectors, quantizing each independently, and representing the original vector by the concatenation of sub-vector codes. Dramatically reduces codebook size.
#### Optimized Product Quantization (OPQ) #Rotation #Optimization
Improving PQ by applying a rotation to the data before splitting into sub-vectors to better balance variance across subspaces.
#### Composite Quantization (CQ) #MultipleCodebooks #Refinement
Using multiple codebooks or quantization stages for finer-grained representation.
