# Amazon AWS WAF #WebSecurity #CloudSecurity #AWS
AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a service that helps protect web applications or APIs against common web exploits and bots that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.

## Core Concepts and Fundamentals #Basics #Introduction #WAF

### How AWS WAF Works #Architecture #Mechanism #Flow
High-level overview of request processing and filtering.

### Key Terminology #Glossary #Definitions
Definitions of essential terms like Web ACL, Rule, Rule Group, etc.

## Web Access Control Lists (Web ACLs) #Configuration #Policy #CoreComponent

### Web ACL Definition and Purpose #Container #PolicyHolder
Role of Web ACLs in associating rules with resources.

### Creating and Configuring Web ACLs #Setup #Management

### Default Action #Fallback #Behavior
Configuring the action (ALLOW or BLOCK) for requests that don't match any rules.

### Scope (Regional vs. CloudFront/Global) #Deployment #Edge
