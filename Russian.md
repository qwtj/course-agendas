# I. Russian Alphabet and Pronunciation

## Cyrillic Alphabet Overview

### Letters identical to Latin alphabet
*   A, E, O, K, M, T
### Letters that look similar to Latin but sound different
*   В (sounds like V), Н (sounds like N), Р (sounds like R), С (sounds like S), У (sounds like U), Х (sounds like H)
### Letters that are completely different
*   Б, Г, Д, Ё, Ж, З, И, Й, Л, П, Ф, Ц, Ч, Ш, Щ, Ъ, Ы, Ь, Э, Ю, Я

## Pronunciation Rules

### Vowel Reduction (Akanie and Okanie)
*   Unstressed 'o' sounds like 'a' (e.g., молоко́ -> [məlɐˈko])
*   Unstressed 'e' and 'я' after palatalized consonants and at the beginning of a word sound like 'и' (e.g., если -> ['jeslʲɪ] or ['jɪslʲɪ])

### Consonant Assimilation
*   Voiceless consonants become voiced before voiced consonants (e.g., сдать [zdatʲ])
*   Voiced consonants become voiceless at the end of a word or before voiceless consonants (e.g., год [ɡot])

### Palatalization
*   Consonants before 'е', 'ё', 'и', 'ю', 'я', and 'ь' become palatalized (softened).

### Stress Placement
*   Stress is not always predictable and can change the meaning of the word (e.g., мука́ [mʊˈka] - flour, му́ка [ˈmuka] - torture).

## Practice Reading and Pronouncing Words
### Simple words with clear pronunciation
*   дом, мама, папа, вода, окно
### Words with vowel reduction
*   молоко, хорошо, спасибо
### Words with consonant assimilation
*   сделать, вокзал
### Words with palatalization
*   письмо, день, люди

*   Russian has six cases: Nominative, Accusative, Dative, Genitive, Instrumental, and Prepositional.

## Nominative Case

### Usage
*   Subject of the sentence

### Example

## Accusative Case

### Usage
*   Direct object of a verb

### Example
*   *Я читаю книгу.* (I am reading a book.) - *Книгу* (book) is in the accusative case.

    * *Я вижу женщину.* (I see a woman.) - Animate.
    * *Я вижу дом.* (I see a house.) - Inanimate.

## Dative Case

# IV. Advanced Grammar Concepts

## Aspects of Verbs (Perfective vs. Imperfective)

### Introduction to Verb Aspects
*   Russian verbs have two aspects: perfective (completed action) and imperfective (ongoing or repeated action).

### Imperfective Aspect
*   Describes actions in progress, repeated actions, or general facts.
*   Answers the question "What was/is/will be happening?"
*   Example: *Я читал книгу.* (I was reading/used to read/am reading a book.)

### Perfective Aspect
*   Describes completed actions, single events, or the result of an action.
*   Answers the question "What happened?"
*   Example: *Я прочитал книгу.* (I read the book/I finished reading the book.)

### Forming Perfective Verbs
*   Often done by adding prefixes to imperfective verbs (e.g., *читать* -> *прочитать*).
*   Sometimes involves changes in the stem.

### Using Aspects Correctly
*   Choosing the correct aspect is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
*   Consider the context: is the action completed, ongoing, repeated, or a general fact?

## Motion Verbs

### Introduction to Motion Verbs
*   A special category of verbs describing movement, often used in pairs (determinate/undeterminate).

### Determinate vs. Undeterminate Motion
*   Determinate: Describing a single, specific movement in one direction. (e.g., *идти* - to go on foot, one direction)
*   Undeterminate: Describing general movement, repeated actions, or round trips. (e.g., *ходить* - to go on foot, generally)

### Examples of Motion Verb Pairs
*   идти/ходить (to go on foot)
*   ехать/ездить (to go by vehicle)
*   лететь/летать (to fly)
*   плыть/плавать (to swim)

### Using Prefixes with Motion Verbs
*   Prefixes change the meaning of motion verbs, often indicating the direction or purpose of movement.
*   Examples: *при-* (arrival), *у-* (departure), *вы-* (out), *в-* (in)

### Examples of Prefixed Motion Verbs
*   *прийти* (to arrive on foot), *уйти* (to leave on foot), *выйти* (to go out on foot), *войти* (to enter on foot)

## Conditional and Subjunctive Moods

### Forming the Conditional Mood
*   Use the past tense of the verb + the particle *бы*.
*   Example: *Я бы хотел...* (I would like...)

### Expressing Hypothetical Situations
*   Use of *если* (if) clauses with past tense verbs and *бы*.
*   Example: *Если бы я знал, я бы сказал.* (If I knew, I would say.)

### Subjunctive Constructions
*   Expressing desires, suggestions, or indirect commands.

## Complex Sentences

### Compound Sentences
*   Connecting independent clauses with coordinating conjunctions like *и* (and), *но* (but), *или* (or).

### Complex Sentences with Subordinating Conjunctions
*   Using conjunctions like *что* (that), *потому что* (because), *когда* (when), *если* (if), *чтобы* (in order to).

### Relative Clauses
*   Using relative pronouns like *который* (which, who) to add information about a noun.
