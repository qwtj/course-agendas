# I. Options Basics

## Understanding Options Contracts

### Definition of a Call Option

*   Right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset at a specified price (strike price) on or before a specified date (expiration date).

### Definition of a Put Option

*   Right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset at a specified price (strike price) on or before a specified date (expiration date).

### Key Option Terminology

*   Strike Price: The price at which the underlying asset can be bought (call) or sold (put).
*   Expiration Date: The date the option contract expires.
*   Premium: The price paid for the option contract.
*   Underlying Asset: The asset on which the option is based (e.g., stock, index, ETF).
*   Intrinsic Value: The profit that could be realized if the option were exercised immediately.
*   Time Value: The portion of an option's premium that reflects the time remaining until expiration.

## Types of Options

### American vs. European Options

*   American: Can be exercised at any time up to the expiration date.
*   European: Can only be exercised on the expiration date.

### Exchange-Traded Options (ETOs)

*   Standardized options contracts traded on exchanges.

## Reading Option Chains

### Understanding Option Symbols

*   Ticker symbols and their components (underlying asset, expiration date, strike price, call/put). Example: AAPL240119C170 (Apple, Jan 19 2024, Call, Strike $170)

### Interpreting Option Chain Data

*   Bid price, ask price, volume, open interest, implied volatility.

# II. Options Pricing and Valuation

## Factors Affecting Option Prices

### Price of the Underlying Asset

### Strike Price

### Time to Expiration

### Volatility

*   Historical Volatility: Past price fluctuations.
*   Implied Volatility: Market's expectation of future volatility, derived from option prices.

### Interest Rates

### Dividends (for stock options)

## Option Pricing Models

### Black-Scholes Model

*   Understanding the inputs and limitations of the Black-Scholes model for European options.
*   Formula: `C = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)` where:
    *   `C` = Call option price
    *   `S` = Current stock price
    *   `X` = Strike price
    *   `r` = Risk-free interest rate
    *   `T` = Time to expiration (in years)
    *   `N(x)` = Cumulative standard normal distribution function
    *   `d1 = [ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2)T] / (σ * sqrt(T))`
    *   `d2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)`
    *   `σ` = Volatility of the stock

### Option Greeks

*   Delta: Sensitivity of option price to changes in the underlying asset price.
*   Gamma: Rate of change of delta.
*   Theta: Rate of decay of an option's value over time.
*   Vega: Sensitivity of option price to changes in volatility.
*   Rho: Sensitivity of option price to changes in interest rates.

# III. Options Trading Strategies

### Buying Calls (Long Call)

*   Profit potential, risk, and breakeven point.

### Buying Puts (Long Put)
