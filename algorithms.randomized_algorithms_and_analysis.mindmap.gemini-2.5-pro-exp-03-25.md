# Randomized Algorithms and Analysis #Algorithms #Probability #Complexity
An overview of algorithms that use randomness as part of their logic and the techniques used to analyze their performance and correctness.

## Introduction and Fundamentals #Basics #Motivation #Overview
Introduces the concept of randomized algorithms, their classifications, and the reasons for using randomness in computation.
### What is a Randomized Algorithm? #Definition #Concept
An algorithm that employs a degree of randomness as part of its logic or procedure. The behavior can depend on random choices (e.g., random bits).
### Why Randomness Helps #Advantages #Efficiency #Simplicity
Randomization can lead to simpler algorithms, improved average-case or even worst-case performance compared to deterministic counterparts, break symmetry, and foil adversaries.
### Types of Randomized Algorithms #Classification #Behavior
Categorization based on performance and correctness guarantees.
#### Las Vegas Algorithms #AlwaysCorrect #VariableTime
These algorithms always produce the correct output, but their running time is a random variable with a bounded expected value. Example: Randomized Quicksort.
#### Monte Carlo Algorithms #ProbablyCorrect #FixedTime
These algorithms run for a fixed amount of time (or have a bounded worst-case time) but have a probability (typically small and controllable) of producing an incorrect result. Example: Karger's Min-Cut, Miller-Rabin Primality Test.
#### Atlantic City Algorithms #ProbablyCorrect #ProbablyFast
A class that is probably correct and probably fast (finishes within expected polynomial time).

## Essential Probability Theory Review #Probability #Tools #Foundations
A recap of fundamental probability concepts essential for understanding and analyzing randomized algorithms.
### Basic Concepts #DiscreteProbability #Events #RandomVariables
Sample space, events, probability measure, axioms of probability, conditional probability, Bayes' theorem, independence.
### Random Variables #Expectation #Variance #Distribution
Variables whose values are numerical outcomes of a random phenomenon. Includes definitions of discrete and continuous random variables, probability mass function (PMF), probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF).
### Expectation (Expected Value) #AverageCase #Linearity
The weighted average of possible values of a random variable. Linearity of Expectation is a key property: E[X+Y] = E[X] + E[Y].
### Variance and Standard Deviation #Spread #Deviation
Measures of how much the values of a random variable tend to deviate from the expected value. Variance(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2].
### Conditional Expectation #Information #Dependence
The expected value of a random variable given that another event has occurred or another random variable has taken a specific value.
### Important Distributions #Bernoulli #Binomial #Geometric #Poisson
Common probability distributions frequently encountered in algorithm analysis, along with their properties.

## Probabilistic Analysis Techniques #Analysis #Methods #Performance
Mathematical tools and methods used to rigorously analyze the behavior of randomized algorithms.
### Expected Running Time Analysis #AveragePerformance #LasVegas
Calculating the average-case time complexity, often using linearity of expectation and indicator variables.
### Success Probability Analysis #Correctness #MonteCarlo
Determining or bounding the probability that a Monte Carlo algorithm yields the correct result. Often involves analyzing failure probabilities.
### Indicator Random Variables #Technique #Counting
Binary random variables (0 or 1) used to indicate whether an event occurs. Extremely useful for calculating the expected value of sums (e.g., number of comparisons in Quicksort).
### Tail Inequalities (Concentration Bounds) #DeviationBounds #Confidence
Inequalities that bound the probability that a random variable deviates significantly from its expectation. Crucial for understanding algorithm reliability and performance stability.
#### Markov's Inequality #BasicBound #NonNegativeRV
Provides a basic upper bound on the probability that a non-negative random variable is greater than or equal to some value. P(X ≥ a) ≤ E[X]/a.
#### Chebyshev's Inequality #VarianceBound #TwoSided
Uses variance to provide a tighter bound than Markov's inequality on the probability of deviation from the mean. P(|X - E[X]| ≥ a) ≤ Var(X)/a^2.
#### Chernoff Bounds #SumOfIndependentRV #ExponentialDecay
Provide exponentially decreasing bounds for the tail probabilities of sums of independent random variables (often Bernoulli trials). Very powerful for analyzing algorithms involving many independent choices.
#### Hoeffding's Inequality #BoundedRV #Generalization
A generalization of Chernoff bounds applicable to sums of independent, bounded random variables, not necessarily identically distributed.
