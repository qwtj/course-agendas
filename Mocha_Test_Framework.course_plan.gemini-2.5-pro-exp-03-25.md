"<prompt> Offer specific techniques for debugging asynchronous test logic, such as properly handling Promise rejections, using `async/await` for clearer stack traces, and strategically placing `console.log` statements or debugger breakpoints, starting at heading level 3.</prompt>"

### Isolating Failing Tests
"<prompt> Reiterate the use of filtering (`--grep`) or exclusive tests (`.only()`) as crucial techniques for isolating specific failing tests during the debugging process, starting at heading level 3. Cross-reference Section VII (Running Tests - Grep) and Section XI (Advanced Features - Only).</prompt>"

### Reflective Prompt
"<prompt> Ask the learner to describe their preferred strategy for debugging a failing asynchronous test in Mocha.</prompt>"

# XVI. Comparison with Other Frameworks

## Jest, Jasmine, AVA, Alternatives
"<prompt> Compare Mocha with other popular JavaScript testing frameworks like Jest, Jasmine, and AVA, highlighting key similarities, differences, strengths, and weaknesses to help learners understand Mocha's position in the ecosystem, starting at heading level 2. Define the learning objectives for this section.</prompt>"

### Mocha vs. Jest
"<prompt> Contrast Mocha with Jest, focusing on differences in philosophy (Mocha's flexibility vs. Jest's batteries-included approach), built-in features (Jest includes assertions, mocking, snapshots, coverage), parallel execution defaults, and configuration, starting at heading level 3.</prompt>"

### Mocha vs. Jasmine
"<prompt> Compare Mocha with Jasmine, noting their similarities as BDD-style frameworks but highlighting differences in built-in features (Jasmine has built-in assertions and basic spies), ecosystem maturity, and community preferences, starting at heading level 3.</prompt>"

### Mocha vs. AVA
"<prompt> Contrast Mocha with AVA, focusing on AVA's emphasis on concurrency (running tests in parallel by default), minimalist core, snapshot testing support, and use of ES modules, compared to Mocha's more traditional execution model and broader feature set, starting at heading level 3.</prompt>"

### Strengths and Weaknesses
"<prompt> Summarize the key strengths of Mocha (flexibility, maturity, large ecosystem, choice of libraries) and potential weaknesses (requires more setup than Jest, core is less feature-rich than some alternatives), starting at heading level 3.</prompt>"

### Section Summary
"<prompt> Provide a final summary comparing Mocha to its main alternatives, reinforcing its core value proposition of flexibility and extensibility.</prompt>"

### Final Reflective Prompt
"<prompt> Ask the learner, based on the comparisons, in what kind of project or team environment would Mocha be a particularly strong choice, and why?</prompt>"
