# I. Introduction to Vector Databases

## Understanding Vector Embeddings

### Definition and Purpose
*   Numerical representation of data (text, images, audio, etc.).
*   Capturing semantic meaning and relationships.

### Embedding Models
*   Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText (for text).
*   CNNs, Transformers (for images).
*   CLIP (for multi-modal data).

### Example: Generating embeddings with Sentence Transformers
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
sentences = ['This is an example sentence', 'Each sentence is converted']
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
print(embeddings)
```

## Introduction to Vector Databases

### Definition and Purpose
*   Databases optimized for storing, indexing, and searching vector embeddings.
*   Enabling similarity search and nearest neighbor retrieval.

### Key Features
*   Efficient indexing algorithms (e.g., HNSW, Annoy).
*   Distance metrics (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance).
*   Scalability and performance.

### Use Cases
*   Recommendation systems.
*   Semantic search.
*   Image retrieval.
*   Anomaly detection.

# II. Core Concepts and Functionality

## Indexing Techniques

### Understanding Indexing
*   Organizing vectors for fast retrieval.

### HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)
*   Hierarchical graph-based index.
*   Efficient approximate nearest neighbor search.
*   Parameters: `M` (number of neighbors), `efConstruction`, `efSearch`.

### Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah)
*   Tree-based index.
*   Building multiple trees for better accuracy.
*   Parameters: `n_trees`.

### Choosing the Right Index
*   Trade-offs between accuracy, speed, and memory usage.
*   Considerations based on dataset size and query requirements.

## Distance Metrics

### Understanding Distance Metrics
*   Measuring the similarity or dissimilarity between vectors.

### Cosine Similarity
*   Measuring the angle between two vectors.
*   Range: -1 to 1 (1 being most similar).
*   Suitable for text embeddings.

### Euclidean Distance
*   Measuring the straight-line distance between two vectors.
*   Smaller distance means higher similarity.
*   Sensitive to vector magnitude.

### Dot Product
*   Calculating the dot product of two vectors.
*   Efficient for normalized vectors.

### Choosing the Right Metric
*   Consider the nature of the embeddings and the desired similarity measure.

## Querying and Filtering

### Nearest Neighbor Search (k-NN)
*   Finding the `k` most similar vectors to a query vector.

### Filtering
*   Applying conditions to the search results.
*   Filtering based on metadata associated with the vectors.

### Example: Performing a similarity search in Pinecone

```python
import pinecone
pinecone.init(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", environment="YOUR_ENVIRONMENT")
index = pinecone.Index("your-index-name")

query_vector = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5] # Example vector

results = index.query(
  vector=query_vector,
  top_k=10,
  include_values=True,
  include_metadata=True #if metadata exists in the index
)

print(results)
```
