# Nodejs #JavaScript #Runtime #Backend
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server-side.

## Introduction & Core Concepts #Basics #Fundamentals #Theory
Understanding the foundational elements of Node.js.
Node.js allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, enabling server-side scripting and command-line tools. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.

### What is Node.js? #Definition #Overview
Node.js is a runtime environment, not a language or framework. It executes JavaScript code server-side. Key aspects include its open-source nature and cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).

### V8 JavaScript Engine #Engine #Performance
Node.js runs on Google's V8 engine, which compiles JavaScript directly into native machine code for high performance.

### Event Loop #Asynchronous #Concurrency #Core
The heart of Node.js's non-blocking I/O. It allows Node.js to handle many connections concurrently within a single thread by offloading operations and processing callbacks when they complete.
It consists of phases like timers, pending callbacks, poll, check, and close callbacks.

### Non-blocking I/O #Asynchronous #IO #Performance
Node.js uses asynchronous, non-blocking I/O operations. Instead of waiting for an I/O operation (like reading a file or network request) to complete, Node.js continues executing other code and handles the result via callbacks, promises, or async/await when ready.

### Single-Threaded Nature (with caveats) #Threading #Architecture
Node.js primarily uses a single main thread for the event loop. However, underlying libraries like `libuv` manage a thread pool (default size 4) for handling potentially blocking or CPU-intensive operations (like some file system operations or cryptography) without blocking the main event loop.

### Libuv #Library #Core #CrossPlatform
A C library providing the event loop, asynchronous I/O, thread pool management, and other operating system abstractions, making Node.js cross-platform.

## Getting Started & Environment Setup #Setup #Installation #Tools
Setting up the development environment for Node.js.

### Installation #Install #NVM
#### Using Installers #Setup #Binary
Downloading and running official installers for Windows, macOS, or Linux.
#### Using Node Version Manager (NVM) #NVM #Versioning #BestPractice
Recommended method for managing multiple Node.js versions easily (`nvm install`, `nvm use`).

### Node REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) #REPL #CLI #Testing
An interactive command-line shell for executing JavaScript code snippets and experimenting with Node.js features.

### Running Node.js Scripts #Execution #CLI
Executing `.js` files using the `node` command (e.g., `node myapp.js`).

### Basic "Hello World" Examples #Example #Beginner
#### Console Output #HelloWorld #Console

```javascript
console.log("Hello World");
```

#### Simple HTTP Server #HelloWorld #WebServer #HTTP

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```


## Modules and Package Management #Modules #NPM #Packages
Node.js's system for organizing code and utilizing third-party libraries.

### Module Systems #Modularity #Import #Export
#### CommonJS Modules #CommonJS #Require #ModuleExports
The traditional Node.js module system using `require()` to import and `module.exports` or `exports` to export.
#### ES Modules (ESM) #ESM #Import #Export #Modern
The standardized module system using `import` and `export` syntax, increasingly supported in Node.js (often requires `.mjs` extension or `"type": "module"` in `package.json`).

### Creating Modules #CustomCode #Reusability
Writing reusable code by exporting functions, objects, or values from a file.

### Node Package Manager (NPM) #NPM #PackageManager #CLI
The default package manager for Node.js, used to install, manage, and publish packages. It's also a command-line tool.
#### `package.json` File #Configuration #Metadata #Dependencies
The manifest file for a Node.js project, containing metadata (name, version, license) and listing project dependencies (`dependencies`, `devDependencies`).
#### `package-lock.json` File #Locking #Reproducibility
Records the exact versions of dependencies installed, ensuring reproducible builds across different environments.
#### Installing Packages (`npm install`) #Dependencies #Installation
Command to install packages listed in `package.json` or specific packages from the registry (`npm install <package-name>`).
#### Managing Dependencies #Dependencies #Versions #Updates
Updating packages (`npm update`), removing packages (`npm uninstall`), checking for outdated packages (`npm outdated`).
#### Scripts (`npm run`) #Automation #Tasks #CLI
Defining and running custom scripts for tasks like starting the application, running tests, or building assets.
#### Publishing Packages (`npm publish`) #Sharing #Registry
Sharing custom modules with the community by publishing them to the NPM registry.
#### NPX (Node Package Execute) #CLI #Tools #Execution
A tool included with NPM for executing Node.js packages without necessarily installing them globally or locally (e.g., `npx create-react-app my-app`).
