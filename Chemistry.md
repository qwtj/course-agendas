# I. Fundamental Concepts

## Understanding Matter and Its Properties

### Defining Matter and Mass
*   Matter: Anything that has mass and occupies space.
*   Mass: A measure of the amount of matter in an object (e.g., grams, kilograms).

### States of Matter
*   Solid: Fixed shape and volume.
*   Liquid: Fixed volume, variable shape.
*   Gas: Variable shape and volume.
*   Plasma: Ionized gas.
*   Phase changes: Melting, freezing, boiling, condensation, sublimation, deposition.

### Physical vs. Chemical Properties
*   Physical properties: Observed without changing the substance (e.g., color, density, melting point).
*   Chemical properties: Describe how a substance changes into a new substance (e.g., flammability, reactivity).
*   Examples: Water boiling (physical), iron rusting (chemical).

## Atoms, Molecules, and Ions

### Atomic Structure
*   Protons, neutrons, and electrons.
*   Atomic number (Z) and mass number (A).
*   Isotopes: Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (e.g., Carbon-12, Carbon-14).

### Molecules and Chemical Formulas
*   Molecules: Two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds (e.g., H2O, CO2).
*   Chemical Formulas: Representing molecules with element symbols and subscripts (e.g., H2O, NaCl).
*   Empirical vs. molecular formulas.

### Ions and Ionic Compounds
*   Ions: Atoms or molecules with a net electric charge.
*   Cations: Positively charged ions (e.g., Na+).
*   Anions: Negatively charged ions (e.g., Cl-).
*   Ionic Compounds: Compounds formed through electrostatic attraction between ions (e.g., NaCl).

# II. Chemical Reactions and Stoichiometry

## Chemical Equations

### Balancing Chemical Equations
*   Law of conservation of mass.
*   Balancing by inspection.
*   Example: `2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O`

### Types of Chemical Reactions
*   Combination (Synthesis): A + B -> AB
*   Decomposition: AB -> A + B
*   Single Replacement: A + BC -> AC + B
*   Double Replacement: AB + CD -> AD + CB
*   Combustion: Fuel + O2 -> CO2 + H2O

### Predicting Products of Chemical Reactions
*   Using activity series for single replacement reactions.
*   Solubility rules for predicting precipitates in double replacement reactions.

## Stoichiometry

### The Mole Concept
*   Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23).
*   Molar mass: Mass of one mole of a substance.

### Mole Ratios
*   Using balanced chemical equations to determine mole ratios.
*   Example: In `2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O`, the mole ratio of H2 to H2O is 2:2 (or 1:1).

### Mass Relationships in Chemical Reactions
*   Converting between grams, moles, and number of particles.
*   Limiting reactant: The reactant that is completely consumed in a reaction.
*   Excess reactant: The reactant that is present in more than the amount needed to react with the limiting reactant.
*   Theoretical yield: The amount of product that should be produced based on stoichiometry.
*   Actual yield: The amount of product that is actually obtained in a reaction.
*   Percent yield: (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) x 100%

# III. Solutions and Aqueous Reactions

## Solutions

### Definitions
*   Solute: The substance that is dissolved.
*   Solvent: The substance that does the dissolving.
*   Aqueous solution: A solution in which water is the solvent.

### Concentration
*   Molarity (M): Moles of solute per liter of solution (mol/L).
*   Molality (m): Moles of solute per kilogram of solvent (mol/kg).
*   Percent concentration: (Mass of solute / Mass of solution) x 100%.

### Solubility
*   Factors affecting solubility (temperature, pressure).
*   Saturated, unsaturated, and supersaturated solutions.

## Aqueous Reactions

### Electrolytes and Nonelectrolytes
*   Electrolytes: Substances that conduct electricity when dissolved in water (e.g., ionic compounds, strong acids/bases).
*   Nonelectrolytes: Substances that do not conduct electricity when dissolved in water (e.g., sugar, ethanol).

### Acid-Base Reactions
*   Acids: Substances that donate protons (H+).
*   Bases: Substances that accept protons (H+).
*   Neutralization reactions: Acid + Base -> Salt + Water
*   Titration: Determining the concentration of a solution by reacting it with a solution of known concentration.

### Precipitation Reactions
*   Formation of an insoluble solid (precipitate) when two aqueous solutions are mixed.
*   Solubility rules: Guidelines for predicting whether a compound will be soluble or insoluble in water.

### Oxidation-Reduction (Redox) Reactions
*   Oxidation: Loss of electrons.
*   Reduction: Gain of electrons.
*   Oxidizing agent: The substance that causes oxidation (and is reduced).
*   Reducing agent: The substance that causes reduction (and is oxidized).
*   Assigning oxidation numbers.
*   Balancing redox reactions using half-reaction method.

# IV. Gases

## Gas Laws

### Pressure
*   Units of pressure (Pa, atm, mmHg, torr).
*   Atmospheric pressure.

### Boyle's Law
*   Relationship between pressure and volume at constant temperature: `P1V1 = P2V2`

### Charles's Law
*   Relationship between volume and temperature at constant pressure: `V1/T1 = V2/T2`

### Avogadro's Law
*   Relationship between volume and number of moles at constant temperature and pressure: `V1/n1 = V2/n2`

### Ideal Gas Law
*   `PV = nRT`
*   R = Ideal gas constant (0.0821 L atm / (mol K) or 8.314 J / (mol K)).

### Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures
*   The total pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases: `Ptotal = P1 + P2 + P3 + ...`

## Kinetic Molecular Theory

### Postulates of Kinetic Molecular Theory
*   Gases consist of particles in constant, random motion.
*   The volume of gas particles is negligible compared to the volume of the container.
*   Gas particles do not attract or repel each other.
*   The average kinetic energy of gas particles is proportional to the absolute temperature.

### Graham's Law of Effusion
*   The rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass: `Rate1 / Rate2 = sqrt(M2 / M1)`

### Real Gases vs. Ideal Gases
*   Deviations from ideal gas behavior at high pressures and low temperatures.
*   Van der Waals equation.
