# Conan Package Manager #Overview #CPP #DependencyManagement
Conan is a decentralized, open-source C and C++ package manager.

## Introduction to Conan #CoreConcepts #WhyConan
Understanding the purpose and fundamental ideas behind Conan.
### What is Conan? #Definition #PackageManager
A tool to manage C/C++ libraries and binaries.
### Why use a C/C++ Package Manager? #Motivation #ProblemSolving
Addresses challenges like dependency hell, binary compatibility, and build consistency in C/C++.
### Conan Philosophy and Goals #Design #Principles
Focus on flexibility, decentralization, build system integration, and binary management.
### Decentralized Nature #Architecture #Distributed
Allows users to host their own packages and servers alongside public repositories like ConanCenter.

## Installation and Setup #GettingStarted #Configuration
Setting up Conan on your system.
### Prerequisites #Requirements #Dependencies
Requires Python and pip.
### Installation Methods #Installation #Setup
Typically installed using pip (`pip install conan`). Platform installers might also be available.
### Basic Configuration #Configuration #InitialSetup
Setting up user home, default profile detection, and initial remote configuration (ConanCenter).
### Verifying Installation #Verification #Check
Using `conan --version` and basic commands to ensure setup is correct.

## Basic Usage: Consuming Packages #Consuming #Dependencies
How to use Conan to install and use existing packages in your project.
### The `conanfile.txt` #Manifest #Requirements
A simple text file listing direct dependencies and generators.
### The `conanfile.py` (as consumer) #Recipe #Requirements
Using a Python script for more complex consumer logic (e.g., conditional requirements, options).
### Specifying Dependencies #Dependencies #Versions
Syntax for requiring packages, including versions or version ranges.
### The `conan install` command #Command #Installation
Downloads dependencies, generates build system integration files.
### Build System Integration (Generators) #Integration #Build
Using files generated by Conan to integrate with CMake, MSBuild, Meson, etc.
### Using Installed Packages in your Project #Usage #Linking
How to find and link against libraries provided by Conan packages within your build system.

## Creating Conan Packages #Packaging #Development
How to define and build your own Conan packages.
### The `conanfile.py` (as creator) #Recipe #Definition
The core Python script defining package metadata, sources, build process, and packaging steps.
### Basic Recipe Structure #Structure #Python
Common attributes (`name`, `version`, `settings`, `options`) and methods.
### Key Methods #Methods #Lifecycle
*   `source()`: Retrieves source code.
*   `layout()`: Defines build/source folders (Conan 2.0+).
*   `generate()`: Prepares build info for consumers (Conan 2.0+).
*   `build()`: Compiles the source code.
*   `package()`: Copies artifacts (headers, libs) into the package folder.
*   `package_info()`: Declares information for consumers (libs, defines, etc.).
*   `package_id()`: Customizes binary package ID generation.
### Defining Settings and Options #Configuration #Variants
`settings`: Immutable build configurations (OS, arch, compiler, build_type).
`options`: User-definable choices for the package (e.g., shared/static library).
### The `conan create` command #Command #PackageCreation
Builds the package from source based on the recipe and specified profile.
### Testing Packages (`test_package` folder) #Testing #Validation
A standard way to include a small test application verifying the package works correctly.
### Exporting Recipes (`conan export`) #Command #Sharing
Places the recipe into the local Conan cache.

## Managing Dependencies #DependencyManagement #Versions

### Version Ranges #Versioning #Flexibility
Specifying acceptable version ranges for dependencies.
### Overrides and Conflict Resolution #Conflicts #Resolution
Handling diamonds in the dependency graph and explicitly overriding versions.
### Transitive Dependencies #Dependencies #Indirect
Dependencies required by your direct dependencies.
### Private Dependencies #Visibility #Requirements
Dependencies needed to build a package but not exposed to its consumers.
### Build Requirements vs Host Requirements #Context #BuildTools
Distinguishing between dependencies needed for the build machine vs. the target machine (cross-compilation).
### Conditional Requirements #Logic #PlatformSpecific
Including dependencies based on settings (e.g., OS) or options.

## Conan Configuration #Settings #Profiles

### Conan Home Directory (`<userhome>/.conan` or `.conan2`) #Storage #Cache
Location of cache, configuration files, profiles, and downloaded packages.
### Profiles (`conan profile`) #Configuration #BuildEnvironment
