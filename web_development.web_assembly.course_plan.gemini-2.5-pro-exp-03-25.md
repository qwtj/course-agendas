## Data Types
"<prompt>Describe the fundamental numeric data types supported by WebAssembly: `i32`, `i64`, `f32`, `f64`."</prompt>

### Code Example: Loading
"<prompt>Provide a JavaScript code snippet demonstrating how to load and instantiate a `.wasm` file using `fetch` and `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming`."</prompt>

```javascript
async function loadWasm() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('module.wasm');
    const results = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(response);
    const instance = results.instance;
    // Call exported functions:
    // const result = instance.exports.exportedFunctionName(args);
    console.log('Wasm module instantiated:', instance);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error loading Wasm module:', err);
  }
}
loadWasm();
```


## Calling Exported Functions
"<prompt>Describe how JavaScript can call functions exported from a WebAssembly module via the `exports` property of the instantiated `WebAssembly.Instance`."</prompt>

### Code Example: Calling Exports

```javascript
// Assuming 'instance' is the result from instantiateStreaming
const sum = instance.exports.add(5, 10); // Calls the exported 'add' function
console.log('Result from Wasm:', sum); // Output: Result from Wasm: 15
```


## Calling JavaScript Functions from WebAssembly (Imports)
"<prompt>Explain how WebAssembly modules can import and call JavaScript functions by defining an `importObject` during instantiation. Describe how this enables Wasm to interact with browser APIs or other JavaScript code."</prompt>

### Code Example: Imports
"<prompt>Provide a JavaScript code snippet showing how to define an `importObject` with a function and pass it during `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming` so the Wasm module can call it."</prompt>

```javascript
const importObject = {
  imports: { // Corresponds to the import namespace in Wasm
    imported_log: function(arg) {
      console.log('Message from Wasm:', arg);
    }
  }
};

async function loadWasmWithImports() {
  // ... fetch response ...
  const results = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(response, importObject);
  // ... use instance ...
}
// Corresponding WAT might look like:
// (module
//   (import "imports" "imported_log" (func $log (param i32)))
//   (func $do_something
//     ;; ... code ...
//     call $log ;; Calls the imported JS function
//   )
// )
```


## Working with Linear Memory

*   **Summary:** "<prompt>Summarize the process of loading (`instantiateStreaming`), exporting functions for JS to call, importing JS functions for Wasm to call, and interacting via linear memory."</prompt>
*   **Glossary:** "<prompt>Define: `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming`, `WebAssembly.Instance`, `instance.exports`, `importObject`, Typed Arrays (`Uint8Array`, etc.)."</prompt>
