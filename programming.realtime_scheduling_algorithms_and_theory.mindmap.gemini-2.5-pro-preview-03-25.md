## Priority-Driven Preemptive Scheduling #Dynamic #Online #Common
Scheduling approaches where tasks are assigned priorities, and the highest-priority ready task runs, potentially preempting lower-priority tasks.

### Fixed-Priority Algorithms (FPPS) #StaticPriority #RateMonotonic
Priorities are assigned statically (offline) and remain constant.
#### Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) #OptimalStatic #Assumptions
Assigns priorities inversely proportional to task periods. Optimal for independent periodic tasks with D=T on uniprocessors under certain conditions.
##### RMS Schedulability Analysis #UtilizationBound #ResponseTimeAnalysis
Techniques to determine if a task set will meet deadlines under RMS.
###### Utilization Bound Test (Liu & Layland) #SufficientTest #Limit
Sum of Utilization (U) <= n(2^(1/n)-1). Simple but pessimistic.
###### Response Time Analysis (RTA) #ExactTest #Iterative
Calculates the worst-case response time (WCRT) for each task. More complex but accurate.
#### Deadline Monotonic Scheduling (DMS) #DeadlinePriority #DM

##### DMS Schedulability Analysis #RTA #UtilizationTestAdaptation
Analysis techniques adapted for DMS.

### Dynamic-Priority Algorithms #ChangingPriority #EDF
Priorities can change during runtime based on task parameters.
#### Earliest Deadline First (EDF) #OptimalDynamic #Uniprocessor
Assigns priorities based on absolute deadlines; the task with the nearest deadline has the highest priority. Optimal for uniprocessors (achieves 100% utilization if possible).
##### EDF Schedulability Analysis #UtilizationBound #DemandBoundFunction
Techniques for EDF analysis.
###### Utilization Bound Test #NecessarySufficient #U<=1
Sum of Utilization (U) <= 1. Simple and exact for uniprocessors.
###### Processor Demand Analysis (PDA) / Demand Bound Function (DBF) #ExactTest #IntervalAnalysis
Checks if the total computation demand within any interval exceeds the interval length.
#### Least Laxity First (LLF) #SlackBased #Dynamic
Prioritizes tasks based on their slack time (laxity = deadline - remaining execution time - current time). Can suffer from high context switching.

### Comparison: FPPS vs. Dynamic Priority #Tradeoffs #Implementation
Comparing RMS/DMS and EDF/LLF in terms of optimality, overhead, predictability, and jitter.

## Resource Access Protocols #Synchronization #Concurrency #MutualExclusion
Mechanisms to manage access to shared resources, preventing race conditions while minimizing blocking and ensuring schedulability.

### The Priority Inversion Problem #Blocking #MarsPathfinder
Low-priority task holding a resource blocks a high-priority task, potentially indefinitely via intermediate-priority tasks.

### Non-Preemptive Critical Sections #Simple #BlockingIssue
Simplest approach but can cause excessive blocking.

### Priority Inheritance Protocol (PIP) #BasicInheritance #ChainedBlocking
A task holding a resource temporarily inherits the priority of the highest-priority task blocked on that resource. Suffers from potential chained blocking.

### Priority Ceiling Protocol (PCP) #BlockingBound #DeadlockPrevention
Assigns a priority ceiling to each resource (highest priority of any task that might use it). A task can only acquire a resource if its priority is higher than all currently locked resource ceilings. Prevents deadlocks and bounds blocking.

### Stack Resource Policy (SRP) / Immediate Priority Ceiling Protocol (IPCP) #StackSharing #ReducedBlocking
Similar to PCP but integrates resource allocation with scheduling, potentially reducing context switches and simplifying analysis. Ensures tasks only start executing if resources are available.

### Partitioned Scheduling #AssignThenSchedule #BinPacking
Tasks are statically assigned to specific processors, then scheduled locally using uniprocessor algorithms (e.g., Partitioned EDF, Partitioned RMS).
#### Task Allocation Algorithms #FirstFit #BestFit #WorstFit
Strategies for assigning tasks to processors (often related to bin-packing heuristics).
#### Schedulability Analysis #LocalAnalysis #AllocationImpact
Analysis combines allocation strategy impacts with per-processor schedulability tests.

### Global Scheduling #SharedQueue #TaskMigration
Tasks reside in a global ready queue and can be dispatched to any available processor. Migration is possible.
#### Global EDF (gEDF) #DynamicGlobal #DhallEffect
Applies EDF logic globally. Can suffer from the Dhall effect (low utilization bound in some cases).
#### Global RMS (gRMS) #StaticGlobal #PoorPerformance
Applies RMS logic globally. Generally performs poorly compared to gEDF or partitioned approaches.
#### Proportional Fair (Pfair) / ERFair #FluidModel #OptimalMultiprocessor

### Utilization-Based Tests #QuickCheck #Sufficient
Simple tests based on processor utilization (e.g., Liu & Layland bound for RMS, U<=1 for EDF). Often sufficient but not necessary.

### Response Time Analysis (RTA) #ExactAnalysis #IterativeCalculation
Calculates the worst-case response time (WCRT) of tasks, considering interference and blocking. Provides necessary and sufficient tests for fixed-priority systems.
