# Tomcat Server #Overview #Apache #WebServer #ServletContainer
Apache Tomcat is an open-source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java Expression Language, and Java WebSocket technologies. It acts as a web server and servlet container, providing a "pure Java" environment for running Java-based web applications.

## Introduction and History #Basics #Context #Background
Provides foundational understanding and historical perspective.
### What is Tomcat? #Definition #Role
Explanation of Tomcat as a web server and servlet container, implementing Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE) specifications like Servlet and JSP. [2, 3, 12, 14, 27]
### History #Timeline #Origins #ASF
Origins at Sun Microsystems (James Duncan Davidson, 1998), donation to Apache Software Foundation (ASF), key release milestones (e.g., v3, v5.5, v7, v9, v10, v11), evolution alongside Java EE/Jakarta EE specs. [2, 3, 14, 27]
### Tomcat vs. Web Server (e.g., Apache HTTPD, Nginx) #Comparison #Role
Distinction: Tomcat processes dynamic Java content (Servlets/JSP), while traditional web servers primarily handle static content. Tomcat can function as a standalone web server or work behind a dedicated web server. [2, 12]
### Tomcat vs. Application Server (e.g., JBoss/WildFly, WebSphere) #Comparison #Scope
Tomcat is primarily a servlet container, not a full Java EE/Jakarta EE application server. Full application servers implement more specifications (EJB, JMS, etc.). TomEE is Tomcat bundled with additional EE features. [3, 4]
### Key Features and Benefits #Advantages #Capabilities
Lightweight, open-source, stable, robust, good performance, large community support, flexible configuration, platform independence. [2, 12, 23]
### Common Use Cases #Applications #Scenarios
Running Java web applications, powering microservices, development and testing environments, small to medium scale deployments. [1, 12, 23]

## Installation and Setup #GettingStarted #Installation #Setup
Covers obtaining and setting up Tomcat on different platforms.
### Prerequisites #Requirements #Dependencies

    #### Using Installers (Windows Service Installer, Package Managers) #AutomatedInstall #OSSpecific
    Steps for Windows installer (`.exe`), Linux package managers (`apt`, `yum`). [1, 11, 15, 21]
    #### Using Docker #Containerization #Docker
    Running Tomcat within a Docker container. [1]
### Initial Verification #Testing #Verification

## Tomcat Architecture #Core #Design #Components
Explains the internal structure and components of Tomcat. [18, 25, 29]
### Overview #ArchitectureDiagram #HighLevel
Hierarchical structure: Server -> Service -> Engine -> Connector -> Host -> Context. [4, 16, 18, 22, 25]
### Server #TopLevel #Instance
Represents the entire Tomcat instance/JVM. Usually only one per installation. Defined by `<Server>` in `server.xml`. [4, 16, 18, 22, 25, 29]
### Service #Grouping #Association
Groups one or more Connectors with a single Engine. Defined by `<Service>` in `server.xml`. [4, 16, 18, 22, 25, 29]
### Connectors #Protocols #Endpoints #Networking
Handle network communication with clients. Listen on specific ports for requests. [4, 6, 12, 16, 18, 22, 25, 27]
    #### HTTP Connector (Coyote) #HTTP #HTTPS #Coyote
    Handles HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 requests. Manages connection pooling, SSL/TLS. Default port 8080 (HTTP), 8443 (HTTPS). [1, 6, 22, 27]
    #### AJP Connector #AJP #Integration #WebServerProxy
    Uses the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) for communication, typically with a front-end web server like Apache HTTPD (`mod_jk`, `mod_proxy_ajp`). Usually port 8009. Requires trust configuration (`secret`, `address`). [18, 22, 34]
### Engine #RequestProcessing #Pipeline
Core request processing pipeline for a Service. Receives requests from Connectors and passes them to the appropriate Host. Defined by `<Engine>` in `server.xml`. [4, 16, 18, 22, 25, 29]
### Host #VirtualHost #DomainName
Represents a virtual host (e.g., `www.example.com`). Associates network names/aliases with the server. Defined by `<Host>` in `server.xml`. An Engine can contain multiple Hosts. [4, 16, 18, 22, 25, 29]
### Context #WebApplication #DeploymentUnit
Represents a single web application deployed within a Host. Defined by `<Context>` in `server.xml` or `context.xml`. Contains servlets, JSPs, static files, etc. [4, 6, 16, 18, 22, 25, 29]

[15, 30, 38]
### catalina.properties #JVM #ClassLoading #SecurityProps
Java properties file setting Catalina-specific properties like classloader paths, security package lists, string cache settings. [4, 16, 38]
