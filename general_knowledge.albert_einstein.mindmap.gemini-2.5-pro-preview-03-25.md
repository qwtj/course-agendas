## Annus Mirabilis (1905) #MiracleYear #Breakthroughs #PhysicsRevolution
Refers to 1905, when Einstein published four groundbreaking papers in the journal *Annalen der Physik*. These papers fundamentally changed the understanding of space, time, mass, and energy. [6, 17]
### Photoelectric Effect #QuantumTheory #LightQuanta #NobelPrize
*   Proposed the idea of light quanta (later called photons), suggesting light behaves as discrete packets of energy. [6, 20, 23]
*   Explained how light ejects electrons from a material, a phenomenon classical physics couldn't account for. [1, 3, 20]
*   This work laid the foundation for quantum theory and earned him the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics. [1, 3, 4, 9]
### Brownian Motion #StatisticalMechanics #Atoms #Molecules
*   Provided a theoretical explanation for the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid. [6, 9, 23]
*   Demonstrated the physical reality of atoms and molecules, using statistical mechanics. [9, 23]
*   Helped convince skeptics about the existence of molecules. [9]
### Special Relativity #Spacetime #SpeedOfLight #Electrodynamics
*   Published in "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies". [6, 17]
*   Reconciled Maxwell's equations for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics. [6, 2]
*   Postulated that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers and that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers. [24, 4]
*   Led to the understanding that space and time are linked (spacetime) and are relative, not absolute. [17, 19]
*   Introduced concepts like time dilation and length contraction. [19, 24]
### Mass-Energy Equivalence #E=mc² #Energy #Mass
*   Derived the famous equation E=mc² in a follow-up paper in September 1905. [1, 17, 24]
*   Established the equivalence of mass and energy, showing they are different forms of the same thing. [9, 24]
*   This principle is fundamental to nuclear physics and energy production. [11, 15]

## Theory of General Relativity #Gravity #SpacetimeCurvature #Cosmology
Developed between roughly 1907 and 1915, published in 1916. [2, 15, 21]
### Core Concepts #EquivalencePrinciple #FieldEquations #Geodesics
*   Describes gravity not as a force, but as a geometric property of spacetime. [13, 18, 24]
*   Massive objects warp or curve the fabric of spacetime around them. [15, 18, 24]
*   Objects in free fall (like planets orbiting a star) follow the straightest possible paths (geodesics) through this curved spacetime. [18]
*   Key principles include the Equivalence Principle (equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass) and the Principle of Covariance. [28]
*   Mathematically described by the Einstein Field Equations, which relate spacetime geometry to the distribution of matter and energy. [1, 18, 29]
### Experimental Evidence #LightBending #MercuryOrbit #GravitationalWaves
*   Predicted the bending of starlight around massive objects, confirmed during a solar eclipse in 1919, catapulting Einstein to international fame. [15, 28, 21]
*   Explained the anomalous perihelion precession of Mercury's orbit. [4]
*   Predicted the existence of gravitational waves (ripples in spacetime), first directly detected in 2015 by LIGO. [1, 4]
*   Other predictions include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, and black holes. [18]
