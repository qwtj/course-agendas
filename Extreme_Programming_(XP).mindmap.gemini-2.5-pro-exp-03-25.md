# Extreme Programming (XP) #Agile #SoftwareDevelopment #Methodology
Extreme Programming (XP) is an agile software development framework designed to produce higher quality software more productively while being adaptable to changing customer requirements. It emphasizes technical practices, teamwork, and customer collaboration.

## Core Values #Philosophy #GuidingPrinciples #Culture
These are the fundamental values that guide XP teams' behavior and decisions.
### Communication #Collaboration #Teamwork
Emphasizes the importance of open and continuous dialogue among team members and with the customer to clarify requirements and solve problems effectively. Practices like pair programming and sitting together facilitate this.
### Simplicity #Minimalism #YAGNI
Focuses on developing the simplest solution that meets the current requirements ("You Ain't Gonna Need It" - YAGNI). Avoids unnecessary complexity and future-proofing, making the code easier to understand, maintain, and change.
### Feedback #Improvement #Validation
Stresses the importance of frequent and rapid feedback loops at various levels (customer feedback on features, test results, peer feedback). This allows the team to adapt quickly and ensure the product meets expectations.
### Courage #Adaptability #Honesty
Encourages team members to tell the truth about progress and estimates, to refactor code when needed, to challenge existing assumptions, and to adapt to changes even if it requires discarding previous work.
### Respect #TeamHealth #Collaboration
Team members must respect each other's contributions, skills, and opinions. This fosters a collaborative environment where everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute.

## Principles #Foundations #Rules
These are derived from the values and provide more specific guidance for XP practices.
### Rapid Feedback #Responsiveness #Learning
Get feedback early and often, and act on it quickly. This applies to tests, customer reviews, and team interactions.
### Assume Simplicity #Focus #Efficiency
Always strive for the simplest design and code that works for the current requirements. Avoid over-engineering.
### Incremental Changes #Evolution #SmallSteps

## XP Practices #Techniques #CoreActivities #Engineering
Specific activities and techniques used by XP teams.
### Fine Scale Feedback Practices #FeedbackLoop #Validation
Practices focused on rapid feedback cycles.
#### Pair Programming #Collaboration #CodeQuality #KnowledgeSharing
Two programmers work together at one workstation. One writes code (driver), the other reviews and thinks strategically (navigator). Roles switch frequently. Improves code quality, shares knowledge, and reduces defects.
#### Planning Game #Requirements #Estimation #Prioritization
Quickly determine the scope of the next release by combining business priorities and technical estimates. Customer presents desired features (user stories), developers estimate effort.
#### Test-Driven Development (TDD) #Testing #Design #QualityAssurance
Write an automated test *before* writing the minimal code necessary to pass that test. Repeat for new functionality. Drives design and ensures test coverage.
#### Whole Team (On-Site Customer) #Collaboration #Requirements #Feedback
A representative of the customer (or the actual customer) is readily available to the team full-time to answer questions, provide feedback, set priorities, and clarify requirements. Ensures the team builds the right product.

### Continuous Process Practices #Improvement #Flow #Efficiency
Practices that support a smooth and continuous development flow.
#### Continuous Integration (CI) #Automation #Integration #Testing
Integrate new or changed code into the main codebase frequently (multiple times per day). Each integration is verified by an automated build and tests. Reduces integration problems and provides rapid feedback.
#### Design Improvement (Refactoring) #CodeQuality #Maintainability #Simplicity
Continuously improve the design of existing code without changing its external behavior. Keeps the codebase clean, simple, and easy to understand and modify.
#### Small Releases #Delivery #Feedback #Value
Release working software into production (or to the customer) in short cycles (weeks rather than months). Provides rapid feedback and delivers value sooner.

### Shared Understanding Practices #Collaboration #KnowledgeSharing #Consistency
Practices aimed at building a common understanding among team members.
#### Coding Standards (Coding Conventions) #Consistency #Readability #Maintainability
Agree on and follow a set of rules for code formatting and style. Makes code easier to read, understand, and maintain by anyone on the team.
#### Collective Code Ownership #Collaboration #SharedResponsibility #Flexibility
Anyone on the team can change any part of the codebase at any time. Encourages shared responsibility, spreads knowledge, and avoids bottlenecks.
#### Simple Design #Minimalism #Clarity #Maintainability
The system should have the simplest possible design that meets the current requirements. Avoids unnecessary complexity. Achieved through TDD and refactoring.
#### System Metaphor #Communication #Architecture #SharedVision
A simple, shared story or analogy that explains the overall structure and workings of the system. Provides a common vocabulary and understanding for the team.

### Programmer Welfare Practices #Sustainability #TeamHealth #Wellbeing
Practices focused on maintaining the team's long-term productivity and health.
#### Sustainable Pace (40-Hour Week) #Wellbeing #Productivity #Quality
Work at a pace that can be sustained indefinitely. Avoid overtime, as it leads to burnout and reduced quality. Ensures long-term productivity and team health.

## Comparing XP with Other Methodologies #AgileComparison #Scrum #Kanban #Waterfall
How XP relates to other software development approaches.
### XP vs. Scrum #AgileFrameworks #Similarities #Differences
*   **Similarities:** Both are Agile, iterative, use cross-functional teams, value customer collaboration, and adapt to change. Both often use user stories.
*   **Differences:** XP is more prescriptive about engineering practices (TDD, pairing, CI, refactoring); Scrum focuses more on project management framework (roles, events, artifacts). Scrum iterations (Sprints) are typically 2-4 weeks, XP often 1-2 weeks. Scrum generally disallows changes *during* a Sprint; XP is more flexible about swapping scope within an iteration if work hasn't started. Scrum has defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Dev Team); XP roles are less formalized (Customer, Developer, Coach, etc.).
### XP vs. Kanban #AgileFrameworks #Flow #WIPLimits
*   **Differences:** XP is iteration-based; Kanban focuses on continuous flow. Kanban uses Work-In-Progress (WIP) limits as a primary mechanism for managing flow; XP manages flow through iteration commitments. Kanban is less prescriptive about specific roles or practices than XP.
### XP vs. Waterfall #AgileVsTraditional #SequentialVsIterative #Flexibility
*   **Differences:** Waterfall is sequential (requirements -> design -> implementation -> testing -> deployment); XP is iterative and incremental. Waterfall resists change; XP embraces change. Waterfall emphasizes comprehensive upfront documentation; XP prioritizes working software and direct communication. Waterfall has distinct phases and specialist roles; XP uses cross-functional teams working collaboratively throughout.
### XP vs. Lean Software Development #AgilePhilosophies #WasteReduction #ValueStream
*   **Similarities:** Both emphasize delivering value quickly, eliminating waste, and continuous improvement.
*   **Differences:** Lean is more of a philosophy and set of principles (eliminate waste, amplify learning, decide late, deliver fast, empower the team, build integrity in, see the whole); XP is a specific methodology with defined practices. XP practices often align well with Lean principles.
