## Foundational Concepts #Basics #Theory #NLP
Core ideas and technologies underpinning GPT models.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) Basics #NLP #Language
Understanding how computers process and generate human language.

#### Tokenization #Preprocessing #Data
Breaking down text into smaller units (tokens).
Example: WordPiece, Byte Pair Encoding (BPE).

#### Embeddings #Representation #Vectors
Representing tokens as dense numerical vectors.
Example: Word2Vec (conceptual precursor), learned embeddings in Transformers.

#### Language Modeling #Prediction #Probability
Predicting the next word (or token) in a sequence given previous words. Statistical basis for text generation.

### The Transformer Architecture #DeepLearning #NeuralNetwork
The specific neural network design that enables GPT. Introduced in "Attention Is All You Need".

#### Self-Attention Mechanism #Attention #Context
Allows the model to weigh the importance of different tokens within the input sequence when processing a specific token. Key for capturing long-range dependencies.

#### Multi-Head Attention #Attention #Parallelism
Running the self-attention mechanism multiple times in parallel with different learned projections, capturing different types of relationships.

#### Feed-Forward Networks (FFN) #NeuralNetwork #Computation
Position-wise fully connected layers applied independently to each position.

#### Positional Encoding #Sequence #Order
Injecting information about the position of tokens in the sequence, as the core Transformer lacks inherent sequential awareness.
