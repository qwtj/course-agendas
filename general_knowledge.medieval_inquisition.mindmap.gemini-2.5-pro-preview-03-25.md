## Origins and Precursors #Background #EarlyChurch #Heresy
Factors leading to the establishment of the formal Inquisition.

### Early Christian Responses to Heresy #Doctrine #Orthodoxy #Patristics
Methods used by the early Church (pre-1000 AD) to deal with doctrinal disagreements.
Focus on theological debate, councils (e.g., Nicaea), excommunication, and reliance on secular rulers for enforcement.

### Rise of Popular Heresies (11th-12th Centuries) #SocialHistory #ReligiousMovements #Dissent
Emergence and spread of large-scale lay religious movements challenging Church authority and doctrine.
#### Catharism (Albigensianism) #Dualism #Languedoc #Theology
Beliefs, practices, and geographic spread (Southern France, Northern Italy).
#### Waldensianism #Poverty #Preaching #LayMinistry
Origins with Peter Waldo, emphasis on apostolic poverty, vernacular scripture, and lay preaching.
#### Other Movements #Mysticism #Reform #Dissent
Brief mention of other groups like Petrobrusians, Henricians, Arnoldists.

### Episcopal Inquisition #CanonLaw #Bishops #EarlyAttempts

### Secular Rulers' Role #Politics #Law #Cooperation
Involvement of kings and lords in suppressing heresy, often for political reasons alongside religious ones. Laws against heresy.

## Establishment and Papal Foundation #Papacy #CanonLaw #Formalization
The formal creation of the Inquisition under papal authority.

### Pope Innocent III and the Albigensian Crusade #Crusade #Languedoc #MilitaryAction
(1209-1229) Initial military approach to suppressing Catharism before the formal Inquisition. Showed limitations of purely military solutions.

### Pope Gregory IX #KeyFigure #Founder #Dominicans
Formal establishment of the Papal Inquisition around 1231-1233.
Appointment of dedicated inquisitors, often from mendicant orders.
Issuance of key papal bulls (e.g., *Excommunicamus*).

### Rationale and Justification #Theology #CanonLaw #SocialOrder

Supreme authority, appointment of inquisitors, issuance of directives and bulls. Use of papal legates.

### Inquisitors #Judges #Clergy #Mendicants
Primarily drawn from the Dominican and Franciscan orders.
Their training, authority, and geographical assignments. Not centrally controlled initially, more regional.

### Mendicant Orders (Dominicans & Franciscans) #Dominicans #Franciscans #KeyPlayers
Reasons for their selection (theological training, mobility, independence from local bishops, commitment to poverty).

### Relationship with Local Bishops #Jurisdiction #Cooperation #Conflict
Shared jurisdiction and frequent tensions between inquisitors and local episcopal authority.

### Ancillary Staff #Notaries #Guards #Familiars
Support personnel: scribes for records, guards, messengers, spies ('familiars').

### Funding and Resources #Finances #Confiscation #Support
How inquisitorial activities were funded (papal support, local church contributions, confiscation of property from the condemned).

## Procedure and Trial Process #LegalHistory #Justice #Investigation
The methods used by inquisitors to identify, investigate, and try suspected heretics.

### Inquisitorial Procedure vs. Accusatorial Procedure #LegalSystems #Innovation #Controversy
Shift from accused having rights/accuser needing proof to the judge (inquisitor) actively investigating.

### *Denunciatio* (Denunciation) #Accusation #Informants #Secrecy
Reliance on denunciations, often anonymous or secret.

### *Inquisitio* (Investigation) #Investigation #Evidence #Secrecy
Process of gathering evidence, summoning witnesses. Lack of transparency for the accused.

### Summons and Arrest #Detention #AccusedRights #Procedure
Bringing the accused before the inquisitor. Pre-trial detention.

### Interrogation #Questioning #Confession #Psychology
Methods of questioning. Strong emphasis on obtaining a confession. Psychological pressure.

Use of witnesses, including those considered unreliable in other courts (e.g., criminals, other heretics). Accused often didn't know who testified against them.

### Legal Counsel and Defense #AccusedRights #Defense #Limitations

### Record Keeping #Documentation #Archives #Sources
Detailed records kept by notaries â€“ a key source for historians today.

### Manuals for Inquisitors #Guides #Procedure #BernardGui
Handbooks written for inquisitors detailing procedures, identifying heresies, and suggesting interrogation techniques (e.g., Bernard Gui's *Practica Inquisitionis Heretice Pravitatis*).

Continued focus on Catharism (until its decline in the early 14th century) and Waldensianism.

Debates within the Franciscan order over apostolic poverty, leading to accusations of heresy against stricter factions.

### Beguines and Beghards #Mysticism #LayPiety #Gender
Lay religious communities (especially women) sometimes suspected of heresy due to their independence and mystical leanings.

### Apostolic Brethren / Dolcinites #Apocalypticism #Poverty #Rebellion
Radical poverty movement led by Gerard Segarelli and Fra Dolcino.

### Early Accusations of Witchcraft #Magic #Superstition #Sorcery
Less systematic than later witch-hunts, but inquisitors sometimes investigated alleged sorcery and demonic pacts, often linking them to heresy.

### Jews and Blasphemy #Antisemitism #Conversion #Blasphemy
While primarily focused on Christian heresy, inquisitors sometimes dealt with cases of blasphemy or alleged reversion by Jewish converts (Conversos), though this was more central to the later Spanish Inquisition.
