*   *Difficulty:* Intermediate

## Planning and Strategy
"<prompt>" Outline the essential steps in the initial planning phase for building a design system: defining clear objectives (e.g., improve consistency by X%, reduce feature development time by Y%), identifying the target audience (internal teams, specific products/platforms), defining scope (what to include initially), and establishing success metrics."

### Inventory and Audit
"<prompt>" Describe the process of conducting a UI audit across existing digital products or interfaces. Explain how to systematically inventory current UI elements (buttons, forms, colors, typography styles), identify inconsistencies, and spot opportunities for reusable components and styles."

### Defining the Team and Roles
"<prompt>" Explain the typical roles and responsibilities needed for a successful design system team (e.g., Product Manager/Owner, Lead Designer, Lead Engineer, Content Strategist, Accessibility Specialist). Discuss different team structures (e.g., centralized core team, distributed model with contributions)."

### Choosing Technology and Tools
"<prompt>" Discuss the key categories of tools used for creating and maintaining design systems and provide examples for each."

#### Design Tools
"<prompt>" Explain how modern design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD are used to create and manage the visual aspects of the design system, focusing on features like shareable libraries, components/variants, styles (color, text), auto layout, and prototyping."

#### Development Frameworks
"<prompt>" Discuss considerations for choosing front-end frameworks or libraries (e.g., React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Web Components) for building the coded component library. Mention the pros and cons of framework-specific vs. framework-agnostic approaches (using Web Components or compiled outputs)."

#### Documentation Platforms
"<prompt>" Compare popular documentation tools and platforms purpose-built for design systems (e.g., Storybook, Zeroheight, Specify, GitBook, custom-built sites). Highlight features like interactive component playgrounds, documentation generation from code/design tools, versioning display, and searchability."

## Creating Core Elements
"<prompt>" Detail the process of creating the foundational visual and interactive elements, emphasizing the connection between design and code."

### Establishing Design Tokens
"<prompt>" Explain the concept of design tokens as the single source of truth for primitive style values (color, typography, spacing, radii, etc.). Describe common formats (e.g., JSON, YAML) and tools (e.g., Style Dictionary, Specify) used to manage tokens and transform them into platform-specific formats (CSS custom properties, Sass variables, Swift/Kotlin code, Android XML). See Cross-Reference: I.B.ii Style Guide."

#### Naming Conventions
"<prompt>" Provide guidance and examples for establishing clear, scalable, and semantic naming conventions for design tokens (e.g., `[category]-[property]-[concept]-[variant]-[state]`, like `color-background-button-primary-hover`). Emphasize avoiding value-specific names (like `red-500`)."

#### Token Transformation Example
"<prompt>" Show a simplified example of a design token in JSON format and how a tool like Style Dictionary might transform it into CSS custom properties.
```json
// tokens.json
{
  "color": {
    "brand": {
      "primary": { "value": "#005FCC" }
    }
  },
  "space": {
    "base": { "value": "16px" }
  }
}
```
```css
/* output.css */
:root {
  --color-brand-primary: #005FCC;
  --space-base: 16px;
}
```"

### Building the Component Library
"<prompt>" Describe the iterative process of designing, building (coding), testing, and documenting individual UI components based on the defined tokens and style guide."

#### Component API Design
"<prompt>" Explain the importance of designing clear, consistent, and predictable APIs (props in React, attributes in HTML/Web Components) for coded components. Provide an example of defining props for a `Button` component (e.g., `variant: 'primary' | 'secondary'`, `size: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'`, `isDisabled: boolean`, `onClick: function`)."

#### Accessibility Implementation

Visual Regression Testing (detecting unintended visual changes, e.g., using Chromatic, Percy, Playwright), 3. Accessibility Testing (automated checks, e.g., using Axe-core, manual testing). See Cross-Reference: III.A.ii.b, V.B.i."
