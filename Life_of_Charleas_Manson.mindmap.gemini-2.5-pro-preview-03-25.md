Predicted an imminent, apocalyptic race war where Black people would kill most White people. [1, 11, 18, 24, 25]
Believed the Family would survive by hiding in the desert (a "bottomless pit" in Death Valley) and emerge to rule over the victorious but supposedly incapable Black population. [1, 11, 18, 25]

Beausoleil's arrest for this murder became a motivating factor for subsequent crimes (to commit copycat killings). [1]
### Tate Murders (August 8-9, 1969) #SharonTate #CieloDrive #Massacre
Manson ordered Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, and Linda Kasabian to 10050 Cielo Drive (former residence of Terry Melcher, rented by Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski). [1, 6, 8, 13]

### LaBianca Murders (August 9-10, 1969) #LenoLaBianca #RosemaryLaBianca #CopycatCrime

His body was buried and not found until 1977, located with help from Steve "Clem" Grogan. [9, 20]

## Investigation and Arrests (Late 1969) #PoliceInvestigation #Arrest #Confession
Bringing the Family to justice.
Initial police investigation was confused, not immediately linking the Tate and LaBianca cases. [1]
Gun used in Tate murders found but improperly investigated initially. [2]
Breakthrough came when Susan Atkins, jailed on other charges (related to Hinman murder/auto theft), confessed her involvement to fellow inmates. [1, 5, 12, 20]
Manson and other Family members were arrested in raids (primarily for auto theft) at Spahn Ranch and later Barker Ranch in Death Valley in October 1969. [2, 12, 20]
Indictments for the murders followed based on Atkins' information and further investigation. [19]

## Trial (1970-1971) #CourtCase #Justice #Prosecution
The legal proceedings against Manson and his followers.
Combined trial for Tate-LaBianca murders began June/July 1970. [4, 20]
Defendants: Charles Manson, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, Leslie Van Houten. (Tex Watson tried separately later due to extradition). [4, 10, 19]
Prosecutor: Vincent Bugliosi. [1, 5, 12]
Key Prosecution Witness: Linda Kasabian, granted immunity for her testimony. [1, 4, 5, 21]
Trial marked by sensationalism and disruptive behavior from Manson and defendants. [1, 4, 25]
Manson carved an 'X' (later modified into a swastika) onto his forehead; female defendants copied him. [1, 25]
Defense Attorney Ronald Hughes (representing Van Houten) disappeared during the trial and was later found dead; Family involvement suspected but unproven. [2, 21]
Prosecution argued Manson ordered the murders to ignite "Helter Skelter," constituting conspiracy and first-degree murder, even though he didn't physically kill Tate/LaBianca victims. [1, 5]
Defense arguments varied; Watson later claimed to be Manson's "unthinking slave". [10]
