This section corresponds to Advanced Error Handling and Debugging.</prompt>"

### Common Errors
"<prompt>Start the response with a heading level 3. List and briefly describe common categories of errors encountered with CloudFormation, such as:
*   Template syntax errors or invalid parameter values.
*   IAM permission issues (for the user or the CloudFormation service role).
*   Resource stabilization errors (e.g., an EC2 instance failing health checks).
*   Dependency errors between resources.
*   Exceeding AWS service quotas.
*   Logical errors in template conditions or resource configurations.</prompt>"

### Using Events
"<prompt>Start the response with a heading level 3. Emphasize the Stack Events log as the primary tool for troubleshooting.

Cross-reference with Section III.E.</prompt>"

### Rollback Process
"<prompt>Start the response with a heading level 3. Explain the automatic rollback process in CloudFormation. Describe how, upon encountering a failure during stack creation or update, CloudFormation attempts to return the stack to its last known stable state (`CREATE_COMPLETE`, `UPDATE_COMPLETE`) by deleting newly created resources or reverting changes. Mention the option to disable rollback (generally discouraged) and the possibility of `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED` states requiring manual intervention.</prompt>"

### Log Analysis
"<prompt>Start the response with a heading level 3. Explain the importance of analyzing logs from the specific resources involved in a failure. Provide examples:
*   Checking CloudWatch Logs for Lambda functions (used in custom resources or macros).
*   Reviewing EC2 instance system logs or application logs (`/var/log/cfn-init.log`, etc.) if helper scripts fail.
*   Examining logs for other services (e.g., ECS task logs, RDS logs) as needed.</prompt>"

### Deletion Errors
"<prompt>Start the response with a heading level 3. Discuss common reasons for stack deletion failures, such as:
*   Resources with `DeletionPolicy: Retain` that prevent automatic cleanup.
*   Dependencies outside the stack (e.g., an S3 bucket that is not empty and lacks a `Retain` policy).
*   IAM permissions issues during deletion.
Explain that these often require manual cleanup of the obstructing resources before the stack deletion can succeed.</prompt>"

### Debugging Complex Scenarios
"<prompt>Start the response with a heading level 3. Offer strategies for debugging more complex issues, such as those involving nested stacks, custom resources, or intricate dependencies. Suggest simplifying the template, testing components individually, adding more detailed logging/outputs, and carefully reviewing resource state transitions in the event log.</prompt>"
