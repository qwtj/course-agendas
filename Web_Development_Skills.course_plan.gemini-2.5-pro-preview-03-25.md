Emphasize its direct impact on user experience and metrics like Core Web Vitals (cross-reference Section IV). Clarify the learning objective: Understand the browser's rendering process and techniques for optimizing rendering speed and smoothness.</llm_prompt>"

## Rendering
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 2 (##), define rendering as the overall process by which a browser engine takes the code (HTML, CSS, JS) and draws the visual representation of a web page onto the screen. Clarify the learning objective: Understand the high-level concept of browser rendering.</llm_prompt>"

## Event loop
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 2 (##), explain the JavaScript Event Loop mechanism in browsers. Describe how it coordinates handling events (user input, network responses), executing JavaScript code (in the single main thread), managing asynchronous callbacks (from Promises, `setTimeout`, etc. via task queues), and triggering rendering updates. Use a simplified diagram or analogy (e.g., queue, stack, heap) to illustrate the flow. Emphasize that long-running JavaScript tasks can block the event loop, delaying rendering and user interaction. Clarify the learning objective: Understand the basics of the event loop and its role in managing tasks and rendering.</llm_prompt>"

### requestAnimationFrame
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 3 (###), introduce `requestAnimationFrame` (rAF) as a browser API specifically designed for scheduling animations or visual updates. Explain that it tells the browser you wish to perform an animation and requests that the browser call a specified function to update an animation before the next repaint. Discuss its advantages over `setTimeout` for animations (smoother, more efficient, pauses when tab is inactive). Provide a simple usage example. Clarify the learning objective: Learn how and why to use `requestAnimationFrame` for JavaScript-driven animations.</llm_prompt>"

### requestIdleCallback
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 3 (###), introduce `requestIdleCallback` as a browser API for scheduling low-priority or deferrable tasks to be executed during periods when the browser's main thread is idle. Explain its use case for non-critical background work (e.g., sending analytics, pre-calculating data) without interfering with critical rendering or input handling. Mention the optional timeout parameter. *Note: Mention browser support limitations.* Clarify the learning objective: Understand the purpose and usage of `requestIdleCallback` for background tasks.</llm_prompt>"

## RAIL Model
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 2 (##), introduce the RAIL performance model (Response, Animation, Idle, Load) as a user-centric framework for thinking about performance. Explain each component and its target goals: Response (handle input in <100ms), Animation (produce each frame in <16ms for 60fps), Idle (maximize idle time for background tasks, use it efficiently with `requestIdleCallback`), Load (deliver initial content and become interactive in <5 seconds, ideally <1 second for critical content). Clarify the learning objective: Understand the RAIL model as a guideline for targeting performance goals across different user interaction phases.</llm_prompt>"

## Critical Rendering Path
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 2 (##), explain the Critical Rendering Path (CRP) as the sequence of steps the browser must take to convert HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into pixels on the screen for the initial view. Outline the key steps: constructing the DOM tree, constructing the CSSOM (CSS Object Model) tree, combining them into a Render Tree, performing Layout (calculating geometry), and Painting the pixels. Emphasize that optimizing the CRP involves minimizing the number of critical resources, their size, and the path length. (Cross-reference Render-Blocking Resources in Section IV). Clarify the learning objective: Understand the sequence of steps in the Critical Rendering Path and why optimizing it is important.</llm_prompt>"

## The Pixel Pipeline
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 2 (##), describe the browser's Pixel Pipeline as the series of stages involved in updating and rendering pixels on the screen in response to changes (e.g., JavaScript changing styles, animations, scrolling). Explain that not all changes trigger all stages, and understanding this can help optimize performance. Clarify the learning objective: Understand the stages involved in rendering pixels and how different changes affect them.</llm_prompt>"

### Style calculations
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 3 (###), explain the 'Style' stage of the pixel pipeline. Describe how the browser calculates the final CSS styles that apply to each element based on selectors, the cascade, and inheritance. Mention that complex selectors or large numbers of style rules can increase the time spent in this stage. Clarify the learning objective: Understand the Style calculation stage.</llm_prompt>"

### Layout
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 3 (###), explain the 'Layout' (or 'Reflow') stage. Describe how the browser calculates the geometry (size and position) of each element on the page after style calculations. Emphasize that changes to properties affecting geometry (e.g., `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `font-size`) for one element can trigger layout calculations for many other elements, making it potentially expensive. Clarify the learning objective: Understand the Layout stage and which CSS properties typically trigger it.</llm_prompt>"

### Paint
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 3 (###), explain the 'Paint' (or 'Rasterization') stage. Describe how the browser fills in the pixels for each element based on the calculated styles and layout, drawing text, colors, images, borders, shadows, etc., potentially onto multiple layers (compositing layers). Mention that changes to properties affecting only appearance (e.g., `background-color`, `color`, `box-shadow`) without changing layout typically trigger only Paint and Composite. Clarify the learning objective: Understand the Paint stage.</llm_prompt>"

### Composite
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 3 (###), explain the 'Composite' stage. Describe how the browser draws the various painted layers to the screen in the correct order, handling transparency and overlap. Emphasize that changes affecting only compositing (e.g., using `transform` or `opacity` on elements promoted to their own compositing layer) are the cheapest to animate, as they often bypass Layout and Paint and can be handled efficiently by the GPU. Discuss how to trigger layer promotion (e.g., `transform: translateZ(0);` or `will-change`), but caution against overuse. Clarify the learning objective: Understand the Composite stage and the performance benefits of compositor-only changes.</llm_prompt>"

## Layout Thrashing
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 2 (##), explain the performance problem known as 'Layout Thrashing' (or Forced Synchronous Layout). Describe how it occurs when JavaScript repeatedly reads layout-dependent properties (like `offsetHeight` or `offsetTop`) and then writes properties that change layout (like `width` or `margin`) in a loop, forcing the browser to synchronously recalculate layout multiple times, severely impacting performance. Provide an example code snippet illustrating the problem and show how to fix it by batching reads and writes. Clarify the learning objective: Understand what Layout Thrashing is, why it's bad for performance, and how to avoid it.</llm_prompt>"

Discuss key mitigation techniques: input sanitization/validation, output encoding (context-aware), and using Content Security Policy (CSP - cross-reference below). Provide a conceptual example. Clarify the learning objective: Understand the concept of XSS attacks and basic mitigation strategies.</llm_prompt>"

### Clickjacking
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 3 (###), explain Clickjacking (UI Redressing) attacks. Describe how attackers trick users into clicking on something different from what they perceive, often by overlaying a malicious page or element invisibly (using iframes and CSS opacity) on top of a legitimate one. Discuss mitigation techniques, primarily using the `X-Frame-Options` HTTP header or the `frame-ancestors` directive in Content Security Policy (CSP) to control whether the site can be embedded in frames. Clarify the learning objective: Understand the concept of Clickjacking and how to prevent it using HTTP headers.</llm_prompt>"

## Content Security Policy (CSP)
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 2 (##), explain Content Security Policy (CSP) as a powerful security layer implemented via an HTTP header (`Content-Security-Policy`). Describe how it allows web administrators to control the resources (scripts, styles, images, fonts, etc.) that the browser is allowed to load for a given page.

Clarify the learning objective: Understand the purpose and basic configuration of Content Security Policy (CSP) for mitigating injection attacks.</llm_prompt>"

## CSS Containment
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 2 (##), briefly introduce the CSS `contain` property. Explain its primary purpose is performance optimization by allowing developers to indicate that an element's subtree is independent, limiting the scope of browser calculations for layout, paint, size, or style. Mention that while primarily for performance, this isolation *might* offer some minor, indirect security benefits in specific scenarios by limiting the potential impact of certain DOM manipulations within the contained element, but emphasize it's not a primary security feature. (Cross-reference performance sections if desired). Clarify the learning objective: Understand the primary (performance) purpose of CSS containment and its limited relation to security.</llm_prompt>"

## Web workers
"<llm_prompt>Starting with heading level 2 (##), introduce Web Workers as a way to run JavaScript scripts in background threads, separate from the main UI thread (cross-reference Event Loop in Section VII). Explain their primary benefit is preventing complex or long-running tasks from blocking the main thread and making the UI unresponsive. Mention that from a security perspective, workers have limited access to the DOM and certain browser APIs, which *can* provide some isolation for potentially risky computations, but they are not a primary security sandbox mechanism in themselves. Clarify the learning objective: Understand the primary (performance) purpose of Web Workers and their limited relation to security isolation.</llm_prompt>"
