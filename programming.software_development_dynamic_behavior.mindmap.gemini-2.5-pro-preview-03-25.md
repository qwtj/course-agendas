# Software Development - Dynamic Behavior #Overview #CoreConcept
Focuses on how software state and behavior change over time during execution in response to events, inputs, and interactions.

## Fundamentals of Dynamic Behavior #Basics #Theory #Concepts
Core principles defining and influencing software dynamics.

### Definition of Dynamic Behavior #Definition #Scope
What constitutes dynamic behavior in software systems versus static structure.
Includes aspects like state changes, interactions, event handling, concurrency, and runtime evolution.

### Importance in Software Development #Motivation #Value
Why understanding and managing dynamic behavior is crucial for correctness, performance, reliability, and user experience.

### Key Elements Influencing Dynamics #Factors #Drivers
- **Events:** External (user input, sensor data) and internal (timers, messages). #Events
- **State:** The condition of the system or its components at a point in time. #State
- **Time:** Temporal aspects, ordering of events, durations. #Time
- **Interactions:** Communication and dependencies between components. #Interactions
- **Concurrency:** Multiple activities happening seemingly simultaneously. #Concurrency
- **Resource Allocation:** Dynamic memory management, thread pooling, connection management. #Resources
