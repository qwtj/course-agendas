# I. Introduction to Sinon.JS

## Understanding Test Spies

### Definition and Purpose of Spies
*   Learn what test spies are and why they are used in unit testing. Spies record arguments, return values, the value of `this` and exceptions thrown (if any) for all their calls.

### Creating Spies with Sinon.JS
*   Using `sinon.spy()` to create a basic spy.

    ```javascript
    const spy = sinon.spy();
    spy("hello");
    console.log(spy.called); // true
    ```

### Inspecting Spy Behavior

*   Checking if a spy has been called: `spy.called`.
*   Checking how many times a spy has been called: `spy.callCount`.
*   Accessing arguments passed to the spy: `spy.args`.
*   Accessing the context (`this`) of the spy: `spy.thisValues`.

## Understanding Stubs

### Definition and Purpose of Stubs
*   Learn what stubs are and their role in replacing real dependencies. Stubs replace functions with complete control over their behavior.

### Creating Stubs with Sinon.JS
*   Using `sinon.stub()` to create a basic stub.

    ```javascript
    const stub = sinon.stub();
    stub.returns(42);
    console.log(stub()); // 42
    ```

### Configuring Stub Behavior
*   Defining return values using `.returns()`.
*   Defining return values for specific arguments using `.withArgs()`.
*   Throwing errors with `.throws()`.
*   Calling a function with `.callsFake()`.

    ```javascript
    const stub = sinon.stub().withArgs(5).returns(10);
    console.log(stub(5)); // 10
    console.log(stub(6)); // undefined
    ```

### Replacing Existing Functions with Stubs

*   Stubbing methods of objects using `sinon.stub(object, "method")`.
*   Restoring original methods using `stub.restore()`.

## Understanding Mocks

### Definition and Purpose of Mocks
*   Learn the concept of mocks and how they're used to verify interactions with dependencies. Mocks are pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls allowed to be made.

### Creating Mocks with Sinon.JS
*   Creating mocks using `sinon.mock()`.

### Setting Expectations on Mocks
*   Using `.expects()` to define expected calls to a method.
*   Specifying the number of times a method should be called: `.exactly()`, `.atLeast()`, `.atMost()`.
*   Checking if all expectations are met using `mock.verify()`.

    ```javascript
    const myObject = { method: () => {} };
    const mock = sinon.mock(myObject);
    mock.expects("method").once().withArgs("foo");
    myObject.method("foo");
    mock.verify(); // Passes the test
    ```

# II. Advanced Sinon.JS Techniques

## Working with Asynchronous Code

### Stubbing Asynchronous Functions

*   Using `.resolves()` to simulate successful promises.
*   Using `.rejects()` to simulate rejected promises.
*   Using `sinon.clock` to control timing in asynchronous tests.

    ```javascript
    const stub = sinon.stub().resolves("Success!");
    stub().then(result => console.log(result)); // Success!
    ```

### Spying on Asynchronous Functions
*   Verifying calls to asynchronous functions.

## Using Sinon.JS with Different Test Frameworks

### Integrating with Mocha
*   Setting up Sinon.JS within a Mocha test environment.

### Integrating with Jest
*   Setting up Sinon.JS within a Jest test environment.

### Integrating with Jasmine
*   Setting up Sinon.JS within a Jasmine test environment.

## Best Practices for Using Sinon.JS

### Avoiding Over-Mocking
*   Understanding the balance between mocking and integration tests.

### Writing Maintainable Tests
*   Ensuring tests are readable and easy to update.

### Properly Restoring Stubs and Mocks
*   Using `sinon.restore()` or `stub.restore()` to avoid test pollution.

# III. Practical Applications and Examples

## Testing Modules with Dependencies

### Isolating Units of Code
*   Demonstrates how to isolate your units of code and inject dependencies.

### Stubbing External API Calls
*   Stubbing a function that makes an HTTP request.

## Verifying Interactions in Complex Scenarios

### Testing Event Handlers
*   Spying on event handlers to verify they are called correctly.

### Testing Complex Workflows
*   Using stubs and mocks to test complex business logic.

## Interim Project: Build a Test Suite for a Simple Application
### Develop a testing strategy
*   Decide which parts of your application will be tested using spies, stubs, and mocks.

### Implementing Tests
*   Implement the tests using a testing framework (Mocha, Jest, or Jasmine) along with Sinon.JS.

### Review and Refactor Tests
*   Review your tests for readability, maintainability, and correctness. Refactor as necessary.
