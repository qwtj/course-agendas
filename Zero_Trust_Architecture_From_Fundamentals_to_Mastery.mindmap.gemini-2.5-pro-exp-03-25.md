# Zero Trust Architecture #Main #Cybersecurity #NetworkSecurity #Paradigm

Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is a modern security model centered on the belief that trust should never be implicit; organizations should assume breach and explicitly verify every access request as though it originated from an untrusted network. It moves defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, applications, and resources, enforcing granular access control dynamically based on real-time context. [4, 1, 11, 27, 6, 8, 20]

## Core Principles #Level1 #Fundamentals #GuidingConcepts

These are the fundamental ideas and strategic imperatives that underpin the Zero Trust security model, dictating how access decisions should be made and security posture maintained. [1, 3, 21, 11]

### Verify Explicitly #Level2 #Authentication #Authorization #ContinuousVerification

Always authenticate and authorize access based on all available data points, including user identity, device health, location, service/workload, data classification, and observed anomalies. Verification is not a one-time event but a continuous process. [1, 3, 21, 11, 27]

#### Identity Verification #Level3 #MFA #Biometrics #Credentials #User #Service #Device

Confirming the identity of the requesting entity (user, service, or device) using strong authentication methods, often involving multi-factor authentication (MFA), before granting any access. [1, 3, 23, 26, 6]

#### Device Health & Compliance #Level3 #PostureCheck #SecurityState #EndpointSecurity

Assessing the security posture and health of the device requesting access, ensuring it meets predefined security standards (e.g., OS version, patch level, security software status) before access is permitted. [1, 10, 23, 25]

#### Contextual Factors #Level3 #Location #Time #Behavior #RiskAssessment

Evaluating various contextual elements like geographic location, time of access request, typical user behavior patterns, and the sensitivity of the resource being requested to inform dynamic access decisions. [6, 23, 11]

#### Dynamic Policy Enforcement #Level3 #AdaptiveAccess #RiskBased #PolicyEngine

Using a policy engine to dynamically determine and enforce access rights based on the combination of identity, device health, context, and predefined security policies. Access can be adjusted in real-time based on changing risk levels. [5, 9, 6]

### Use Least Privilege Access #Level2 #AccessControl #Minimization #JIT #JEA

Grant only the minimum necessary permissions required for a user or system to perform its specific task, for only the required duration. This limits potential damage if an account or device is compromised. [1, 3, 21, 27, 10]

#### Just-In-Time (JIT) Access #Level3 #TemporaryPermissions #DynamicAccess

Providing access privileges only when needed and automatically revoking them after a predetermined time or task completion, minimizing standing privileges. [1]

#### Just-Enough-Access (JEA) #Level3 #GranularPermissions #RoleBasedAccess #AttributeBasedAccess
