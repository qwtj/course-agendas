# Latin Cases #Grammar #Inflection #Latin
Latin is an inflected language where the function of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives within a sentence is indicated by their endings, known as cases.

## Introduction to Cases #Overview #Basics #Syntax
Cases are variations in the form of a noun, pronoun, or adjective that signal its grammatical role (like subject, object, possessor) in a sentence. Latin primarily uses 6 cases, with vestiges of a 7th. Understanding cases is fundamental to understanding Latin syntax and allows for flexible word order.

### What are Cases? #Definition #Morphology
Explanation of grammatical case as a system of marking nouns, pronouns, and adjectives for grammatical function.
Latin case endings indicate number (singular/plural) and case, and often align with gender (masculine, feminine, neuter).

### Why are Cases Important? #Syntax #Function
Cases determine relationships between words, clarifying who does what, to whom, with what, etc.
Essential for translation and comprehension due to Latin's flexible word order.

### How Many Cases in Latin? #Enumeration #List
Standard Latin grammar recognizes 6 main cases.
A 7th case (Locative) exists in limited forms.

### Order of Cases #Convention #Pedagogy
Different traditions list cases in varying orders (e.g., US vs. European).
Common US order: Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative, Ablative, Vocative (Mnemonic: Never Gag Down An Ant Violently).
Other common order: Nominative, Vocative, Accusative, Genitive, Dative, Ablative.

## The Six Main Cases #CoreConcepts #Grammar #Function
Detailed exploration of each primary case and its functions.

### Nominative Case #Nominative #Subject #Predicate
Typically indicates the subject of a finite verb (the person or thing performing the action or being described).
Used for predicate nominatives (nouns or adjectives linked to the subject by a copulative verb like *sum*, 'to be').
*Example: **Puella** cantat. (The **girl** sings - Subject)*
*Example: Puella est **bona**. (The girl is **good** - Predicate Adjective)*

### Genitive Case #Genitive #Possession #Relationship
Primarily indicates possession ('s, of).
Indicates various relationships often translated with "of" (origin, description, partitive).
Used with certain verbs (e.g., verbs of remembering, forgetting, accusing, convicting) and adjectives.
*Example: Liber **puerī**. (The book **of the boy** / The **boy's** book - Possession)*
*Example: Amor **patriae**. (Love **of country** - Objective Genitive)*
*Example: Accūsō tē **furtī**. (I accuse you **of theft** - Genitive with Verb)*

### Dative Case #Dative #IndirectObject #Reference
Primarily indicates the indirect object (to/for whom or what an action is done).
Used with many intransitive verbs (e.g., *credere* 'to believe', *parcere* 'to spare', *nocere* 'to harm').
Used with many compound verbs.
Indicates reference or interest (Dative of Reference/Interest).
Indicates possession with *esse* (Dative of Possession).
Used with certain adjectives (e.g., *amicus* 'friendly to', *similis* 'similar to').
*Example: Librum **puellae** dat. (He gives the book **to the girl** - Indirect Object)*
*Example: **Mihi** crēdit. (He believes **me** - Dative with Special Verb)*
*Example: Est liber **mihi**. (There is a book **to me** = I have a book - Dative of Possession)*

### Accusative Case #Accusative #DirectObject #Motion
Primarily indicates the direct object (the person or thing directly receiving the action of a transitive verb).
Used as the object of many prepositions, often indicating motion towards (*ad*, *in* [motion], *per*, *trans*).
Indicates duration of time or extent of space.
Used as the subject of an infinitive in indirect statements.
Indicates place to which (with names of cities, small islands, *domus*, *rus*).
*Example: **Puellam** videt. (He sees **the girl** - Direct Object)*
*Example: Ad **urbem** it. (He goes **to the city** - Object of Preposition)*
*Example: Multōs **annōs** vīxit. (He lived for many **years** - Duration of Time)*
*Example: Dīcit **puerum** venīre. (He says **that the boy** is coming - Subject of Infinitive)*

### Ablative Case #Ablative #Adverbial #Prepositions
A highly versatile case, combining functions of Proto-Indo-European ablative (separation), instrumental (means/manner), and locative (place/time).
Used as the object of certain prepositions (*a/ab*, *cum*, *de*, *e/ex*, *in* [location], *sine*, *sub* [location]).
Indicates means or instrument (by/with what).
Indicates manner (how).
Indicates agent in passive constructions (by whom - with *a/ab*).
Indicates separation (from what).
Indicates place where (often with prepositions, but also without for Locative uses).
Indicates time when or within which.
Indicates accompaniment (with whom - requires *cum*).
Indicates comparison.
Indicates respect or specification.
Ablative Absolute construction.
*Example: Gladio **pugnat**. (He fights **with a sword** - Ablative of Means)*
*Example: **Magnā cum laude** scrīpsit. (He wrote **with great praise** - Ablative of Manner with *cum*)*
*Example: Ab **hostibus** captus est. (He was captured **by the enemy** - Ablative of Agent)*
*Example: **Rōmā** venit. (He comes **from Rome** - Ablative of Separation)*
*Example: **Aestāte** iter facit. (He travels **in the summer** - Ablative of Time When)*

### Vocative Case #Vocative #Address
Used for direct address (calling someone or something by name).
Usually identical to the Nominative form.
Exception: 2nd declension masculine nouns ending in *-us* change to *-e* (e.g., *Marcus* -> *Marce*).
Exception: 2nd declension masculine nouns ending in *-ius* change to *-ī* (e.g., *Filius* -> *Filī*).
*Example: Salvē, **Marce**! (Hello, **Marcus**!)*
*Example: Ō **fortūna**! (O **Fortune**!)*

## The Locative Case #Locative #PlaceWhere #Residual
A seventh case mostly merged with the Ablative in Classical Latin.
Indicates location ('place where').
Survives primarily with names of cities, towns, small islands, and a few specific nouns (*domus*, *humus*, *rus*).
Forms often resemble Genitive singular (1st/2nd decl.) or Ablative singular/plural (3rd decl. / Plural names).
*Example: **Rōmae** habitat. (He lives **in Rome**.)*
*Example: **Domī** manet. (He stays **at home**.)*
*Example: **Athēnīs** studet. (He studies **in Athens**.)*

## Cases and Declensions #Morphology #Endings #Paradigms
Case is marked by endings added to a noun/adjective stem. These endings vary according to the noun's declension (pattern of endings).
Latin has 5 main declensions.

### Identifying Cases #Endings #DeclensionSystem
Recognizing the case ending is crucial for determining a word's function.
Each declension has a characteristic set of endings for each case in singular and plural.

### First Declension (-a stem) #Declension1 #Feminine
Mostly feminine nouns (e.g., *puella*, girl).
Genitive Singular: *-ae*

### Second Declension (-o stem) #Declension2 #Masculine #Neuter
Masculine nouns (e.g., *servus*, slave; *puer*, boy) and Neuter nouns (e.g., *bellum*, war).
Genitive Singular: *-ī*

### Third Declension (consonant & -i stems) #Declension3 #MixedGender
Masculine, Feminine, and Neuter nouns with varied Nominative forms.
Genitive Singular: *-is*

### Fourth Declension (-u stem) #Declension4 #Masculine #Neuter
Mostly Masculine nouns (e.g., *manus*, hand), some Feminine, few Neuter (e.g., *cornū*, horn).
Genitive Singular: *-ūs*

### Fifth Declension (-e stem) #Declension5 #Feminine
Mostly Feminine nouns (e.g., *rēs*, thing; *diēs*, day - sometimes masculine).
Genitive Singular: *-eī*

## Cases and Syntax #SentenceStructure #GrammarRules
How cases interact to form meaningful sentences.

### Subject-Verb Agreement #Nominative #Agreement
The verb agrees in person and number with its Nominative subject.

### Objects (Direct & Indirect) #Accusative #Dative
Transitive verbs take Accusative direct objects.
Verbs of giving, showing, telling often take Dative indirect objects alongside Accusative direct objects.

### Modifiers #Genitive #Adjectives #Agreement
Genitive nouns modify other nouns.
Adjectives agree with the nouns they modify in Gender, Number, and Case.

## Cases with Prepositions #Prepositions #Accusative #Ablative
Prepositions govern specific cases, primarily Accusative or Ablative.

### Prepositions + Accusative #MotionTowards #Extent
Often indicate motion towards, extent through space or time.
Common examples: *ad* (to, towards), *per* (through), *post* (after), *trans* (across), *inter* (between), *ante* (before), *circum* (around), *contrā* (against), *in* (into, onto, against).

### Prepositions + Ablative #Location #Separation #Accompaniment
Often indicate location, separation, accompaniment, instrument.
Common examples: *a/ab* (from, by), *cum* (with), *de* (down from, about), *e/ex* (out of, from), *sine* (without), *prō* (for, in front of), *in* (in, on), *sub* (under - location).

### Prepositions + Accusative OR Ablative #DualCasePrepositions #MeaningShift
Some prepositions take either case, with a change in meaning.
*in*: + Acc = into/onto (motion); + Abl = in/on (location).
*sub*: + Acc = under (motion to); + Abl = under (location).
*super*: + Acc = over (motion); + Abl = on top of, concerning.

## Special Case Constructions #Idioms #AdvancedSyntax
Specific grammatical patterns involving cases.

### Ablative Absolute #Ablative #Participle #AdverbialClause
A common construction using a noun/pronoun and a participle (or another noun/adjective) in the Ablative case to form an independent adverbial phrase.
*Example: **Urbe captā**, hostēs discessērunt. (**The city having been captured**, the enemies departed.)*

### Dative of Possession #Dative #Possession #Esse
Using the Dative case with a form of the verb *esse* ('to be') to express possession.
*Example: **Mihi** est liber. (A book is **to me** = I have a book.)*

### Dative of Purpose #Dative #Purpose #Goal
Using the Dative case to show the purpose or end for which something serves. Often paired with a Dative of Reference.
*Example: Hoc **mihi** **curae** est. (This is **for a care** **to me** = This is a concern for me.)*

### Double Dative #Dative #Purpose #Reference
The combination of a Dative of Purpose and a Dative of Reference.

### Accusative of Extent/Duration #Accusative #Space #Time
Using the Accusative case (without a preposition) to indicate how long (time) or how far (space).
*Example: **Decem annōs** regnāvit. (He reigned **for ten years**.)*
*Example: **Multa milia passuum** ambulāvit. (He walked **for many miles**.)*

## Historical Context & Development #Linguistics #IndoEuropean #Evolution
Brief look at the origins and evolution of the Latin case system.

### Proto-Indo-European Origins #PIE #CaseSystem
Latin cases evolved from the case system of Proto-Indo-European (PIE), which likely had 8 cases (Nominative, Vocative, Accusative, Genitive, Dative, Ablative, Locative, Instrumental).

### Merging of Cases #Syncretism #Ablative
In Latin, the original PIE Ablative (separation), Locative (place/time where), and Instrumental (means/accompaniment) functions largely merged into the Latin Ablative case.

### Loss of Cases in Romance Languages #Evolution #RomanceLanguages
The complex case system of Latin was gradually simplified and largely lost in its descendants, the Romance languages (French, Spanish, Italian, etc.), which rely more on prepositions and word order.
