**Learning Objectives**: Understand prompt engineering principles, techniques, and applications with LLMs.

**Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of machine learning and natural language processing concepts.

**Depth & Scope**: Overview of fundamental and advanced prompting techniques, evaluation, and security considerations.

**Target Audience**: Entry-level machine learning engineers, NLP enthusiasts, and developers.

**Technical Details**:

*   Transformer architecture: `Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax((QK^T) / sqrt(d_k))V`
*   Tokenization example: `"Hello world" -> [78, 234]`
*   Zero-shot: `"Translate 'hello' to French."`
*   Few-shot:
    ```
    Prompt: "Translate English to French:
    English: Hello
    French: Bonjour
    English: Goodbye
    French:"
    ```
*   Chain-of-Thought: `"Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now? Let's think step by step."`
*   Prompt Template: `"Summarize the following article about {topic} published by {source}: {article_text}"`
*   Question Answering: `context: {context} question: {question}`
*   Text Summarization: `"Summarize the following text: {text}"`
*   Code Generation: `"Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number."`

**Relevant Technologies/Tools**: Python, Jinja2, Large Language Models (LLMs).

**Preferred Format/Length**: Detailed explanations with concise examples.
