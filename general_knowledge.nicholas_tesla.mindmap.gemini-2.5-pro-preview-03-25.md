Details about Tesla's birth, family background, early education, and formative experiences.
### Birth and Family #Origins #Smiljan #Serbia
Born an ethnic Serb on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia).
Father: Milutin Tesla, an Eastern Orthodox priest.
Mother: Georgina "Đuka" Mandić, an inventor of home craft tools and appliances, highly intelligent despite no formal education. Tesla credited her for his creative abilities and eidetic memory.
Siblings: Fourth of five children; older brother Dane died in a riding accident when Nikola was young. Three sisters: Milka, Angelina, Marica.
### Early Influences #Childhood #Inspiration
Showed interest in electricity from physics demonstrations.
Mother's inventiveness was a key influence.
Brother's death deeply affected him, possibly contributing to lifelong mental health challenges and reported visions.
Early inventions: Started inventing as a child (e.g., June bug motor, frog catching device).
### Education #Studies #Engineering #Physics
Primary school in Smiljan (German, arithmetic, religion).
Moved to Gospić in 1862; completed primary and middle school.
Higher Real Gymnasium in Karlovac (finished 4-year term in 3 years, graduated 1873).
Contracted cholera in 1873, bedridden for nine months.
Attended Austrian Polytechnic (Technical University) in Graz, Austria (1875), studying math and physics. Saw the Gramme dynamo here, sparking ideas about AC. Lost scholarship and dropped out after second year.
Studied philosophy at the University of Prague (did not receive a degree).
### Early Career and Experiences #Work #Europe #Telephony
Worked as a draftsman in Maribor, Slovenia (1878). Deported back to Gospić (1879).
Taught in Gospić after his father's death (1879).
Moved to Budapest (1881) to work at the Budapest Telephone Exchange; made improvements and developed an amplifier. Conceived the idea for the induction motor here (1882).
Worked for Continental Edison Company in Paris (1882), installing lighting systems and repairing DC dynamos. Invented an automatic regulator.

## Immigration to the United States and Early Career #America #Edison #Beginnings
Tesla's move to the US and his initial work experiences, including his time with Thomas Edison.
### Arrival in America #NewYork #1884
Immigrated to the US in 1884 at age 28, arriving in New York City with minimal funds.
### Working with Thomas Edison #EdisonMachineWorks #Rivalry #DC
Hired as an engineer at Thomas Edison's Manhattan headquarters.
Impressed Edison with his diligence and ingenuity.
Improved Edison's DC dynamos, but Edison allegedly reneged on a promised $50,000 bonus, leading to Tesla's resignation after about a year. This marked the beginning of their rivalry.

## Independent Inventor and Entrepreneurship #Innovation #Business #AC
Tesla's efforts to establish his own companies and develop his inventions.
### Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing #FirstCompany #ArcLighting #Setback
Founded in 1885 with funding.
Tasked with developing improved arc lighting.

Had to work digging ditches for a period.
### Tesla Electric Company #SecondCompany #Funding #ACDevelopment
Established in 1887 with new financial backing.

## The War of the Currents #ACvsDC #Edison #Westinghouse
The intense commercial and technological battle between Tesla's AC system and Edison's DC system.
### AC vs. DC Technology #AlternatingCurrent #DirectCurrent #Transmission
DC (Edison): Flows in one direction, difficult to convert voltages, inefficient for long-distance transmission.
AC (Tesla): Reverses direction periodically, easily transformed to high voltages for efficient long-distance transmission and stepped down for use.
### Partnership with George Westinghouse #WestinghouseElectric #Licensing #Support
Westinghouse, seeking long-distance power solutions, licensed Tesla's AC induction motor and polyphase AC patents in 1888.
This provided Tesla with substantial funds and became the cornerstone of Westinghouse's AC system.
### Edison's Campaign Against AC #Propaganda #SafetyConcerns #Electrocution
Edison launched a campaign to discredit AC, spreading misinformation about its dangers.
Publicly electrocuted animals using AC.
Advocated for AC use in the electric chair (first used 1890) to associate it with death.
### Triumph of AC #ChicagoWorldsFair #NiagaraFalls #Standardization
1893 World's Columbian Exposition (Chicago World's Fair): Lit by Tesla and Westinghouse using AC, showcasing its capabilities.
Niagara Falls Power Plant (1895-1896): First major hydroelectric plant, designed by Tesla, used AC generators built by Westinghouse, transmitting power to Buffalo, NY. Marked the unofficial end of the War of the Currents. AC became the dominant standard.
