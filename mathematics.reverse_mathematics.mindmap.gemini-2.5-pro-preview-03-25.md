# Reverse Mathematics #Foundations #Logic #Computability
Reverse mathematics is a program in mathematical logic that aims to determine the minimum set of axioms required to prove specific theorems of ordinary (non-set-theoretic) mathematics. It works "backwards" from theorems to axioms. [1, 2, 3, 6]

## Introduction and Goals #Overview #Motivation #Philosophy
Provides context, defines the core objective, and outlines the philosophical significance of the program. [1, 3, 5, 21]
### Definition and Purpose #CoreConcept #Axioms #Theorems
Defining reverse mathematics as the search for minimal axiom systems necessary for proving mathematical theorems. [1, 3, 5] The goal is to determine the precise logical strength of mathematical theorems by finding equivalences between theorems and specific axiomatic systems over a weak base theory. [3, 5, 9, 11]
### Historical Context #History #Friedman #Simpson
The program was founded by Harvey Friedman around 1975 and significantly developed by Stephen Simpson and his students. [1, 3, 11] It has roots in earlier work in set theory (e.g., equivalence of Axiom of Choice and Zorn's Lemma), proof theory, constructive analysis, and computability theory (recursive counterexamples). [1, 2, 22]
### Methodology: "Going Backwards" #Methodology #Reversal #Equivalence
The core method involves proving equivalences of the form `Base Theory + Theorem ↔ Axiom System`. [1, 3, 5] A proof from the axiom system to the theorem is the standard mathematical direction; the proof from the theorem (plus base theory) back to the axiom system is the "reversal". [3, 4, 12] This sculpts out necessary conditions from sufficient ones. [1, 6]
### Philosophical Significance #Foundations #Epistemology #Ontology
Explores the foundational assumptions underlying different areas of mathematics. [8, 21, 22] Aims to understand the inherent logical strength and set existence principles required for theorems, providing insights into mathematical necessity and structure. [2, 3, 9, 24] Investigates connections to foundational programs like finitism, predicativism, and constructivism. [8, 21, 22]

## Foundational Framework #Formalism #Language #BaseTheory
Defines the formal setting used in most reverse mathematics research. [1, 2, 3]
### Second-Order Arithmetic (Z2) #Language #Framework #Arithmetic
The primary formal language used, encompassing variables for natural numbers and sets of natural numbers. [1, 3, 4] Allows coding of many mathematical objects (reals via Cauchy sequences, countable structures, etc.) as sets of natural numbers. [1, 2, 10]
### Base Theory: RCA₀ #BaseSystem #Computability #RecursiveComprehension
Recursive Comprehension Axiom₀ (RCA₀) is the standard weak base system. [1, 3, 4, 5] It includes basic arithmetic, restricted induction, and comprehension for computable (recursive, Δ¹₀) sets. [3, 5, 33] RCA₀ formalizes "computable mathematics"; sets provably existing in RCA₀ are computable. [1, 2, 3] Most equivalences are proven over RCA₀. [3, 7]
### Coding Mathematical Objects #Representation #Coding #Formalization
Techniques for representing objects from various mathematical fields (analysis, algebra, topology) within the language of second-order arithmetic, often using sets of natural numbers. [1, 2, 4, 10] For example, real numbers are often coded as Cauchy sequences of rationals. [1]

## The "Big Five" Subsystems #Subsystems #Hierarchy #SetExistence
A hierarchy of five key subsystems of second-order arithmetic that classify the strength of a vast number of mathematical theorems. [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]
### RCA₀ (Recursive Comprehension Axiom) #ComputableMath #BaseLevel
The base system itself, corresponding to computable mathematics. [1, 3, 5] Theorems provable here generally have computable content. [3]
### WKL₀ (Weak Kőnig's Lemma) #Compactness #ComputabilityTheory #ChoicePrinciple
RCA₀ plus Weak Kőnig's Lemma (every infinite binary tree has a path). [1, 5] Equivalent to compactness principles (e.g., compactness of [0,1], Heine-Borel for countable covers), existence of prime ideals in countable rings, and separation principles. [2, 3, 4, 5] Corresponds roughly to finitistic reductionism but introduces non-computable sets. [4]
### ACA₀ (Arithmetical Comprehension Axiom) #Predicativity #Analysis #Arithmetic
RCA₀ plus comprehension for arithmetical formulas (formulas with only number quantifiers). [1, 5] Equivalent to the existence of the Turing jump for any set, Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, sequential compactness of [0,1], completeness of the real numbers, and Kőnig's Lemma for general countable trees. [3, 4, 5, 19] Has the proof-theoretic strength of Peano Arithmetic (PA). [4] Corresponds roughly to predicativism. [7]
### ATR₀ (Arithmetical Transfinite Recursion) #PredicativismLimit #SetTheory #WellOrdering
ACA₀ plus the principle allowing iteration of arithmetical comprehension along any countable well-ordering. [1, 5] Equivalent to comparability of countable well-orderings, open/clopen determinacy, Ulm's theorem for countable reduced abelian groups, and परफेक्ट set theorems (e.g., Cantor-Bendixson). [1, 4, 25] Marks the limit of predicative mathematics. [4]
### Π¹₁-CA₀ (Π¹₁ Comprehension Axiom) #Impredicativity #AnalysisStrong #SetTheoryStrong
ATR₀ plus comprehension for Π¹₁ formulas (formulas with one universal set quantifier). [1, 4, 5] Equivalent to theorems involving more complex sets, like existence of canonical well-orderings for countable structures. [4] Represents a level of impredicativity. [4]

## Methodology and Techniques #ProofMethods #LogicTools #Computability
Tools and approaches used within the field. [1, 2, 3]
### Proving Equivalences #Reversals #FormalProofs
Demonstrating both `System → Theorem` (standard proof within the system) and `RCA₀ + Theorem → System` (the reversal). [3, 4, 12] Reversals often require deeper insight. [3]
### Model Theory (ω-models and β-models) #Models #Semantics #ComputableEntailment
Using models, especially ω-models (standard natural numbers) and β-models, to establish non-provability and equivalences. [1, 8] ω-models of RCA₀ consist of the standard integers and a collection of sets closed under Turing reducibility and join. [30] Computational reverse mathematics focuses on ω-models. [8, 12]
### Computability Theory Techniques #RecursionTheory #Definability #Complexity
Employing concepts like Turing degrees, relative computability, the arithmetical hierarchy, and hyperarithmetical theory. [1, 2, 19] Many subsystems correspond to closure under specific computability-theoretic operations (e.g., ACA₀ and the Turing jump). [5]
### Proof Theory Techniques #OrdinalAnalysis #ConsistencyStrength #Reduction
Using proof-theoretic methods like ordinal analysis to measure the strength of subsystems. [4, 9, 19] RCA₀ is finitistically reducible; ACA₀ has the strength of PA (ordinal ε₀); ATR₀ relates to predicativity; Π¹₁-CA₀ is stronger. [4]
