## Interrupt Handling Process
"Generate content starting at heading level 2 outlining the sequence of events when an interrupt (like IRQ or FIQ) is accepted by the processor. Describe the steps: 1. Processor finishes the current instruction (usually). 2. Saves the return address (current PC+offset) to the LR of the target mode. 3. Saves the current CPSR to the SPSR of the target mode. 4. Changes processor mode (e.g., to IRQ or FIQ mode). 5. Sets interrupt disable flags in the new CPSR (disables IRQ, potentially FIQ depending on mode). 6. Sets the PC to the address found in the corresponding vector table entry. Explain that the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) then executes, identifies the specific interrupt source (if multiple sources exist), services the request, clears the interrupt flag, restores saved state (registers), and returns using a special instruction variant that restores PC from LR and CPSR from SPSR (e.g., `SUBS PC, LR, #offset`)."

## FIQ (Fast Interrupt Request)
"Generate content starting at heading level 2 specifically describing the Fast Interrupt Request (FIQ). Explain its characteristics: higher priority than IRQ, designed for lower latency handling. Mention that FIQ mode has more banked registers (R8-R12) compared to IRQ mode, reducing the need to

"Generate content starting at heading level 2 explaining how to call an assembly language function from C or C++ code. Describe the process: 1. Write the assembly function, ensuring it adheres to the AAPCS (argument passing, return value, register preservation). 2. Make the function's label visible externally using the `.global` directive in assembly. 3. Declare the function prototype in C/C++ using the `extern` keyword. 4. Compile the C/C++ code and assemble the assembly code separately. 5. Link the resulting object files together."
*   "Provide a simple example: an assembly function `asm_add(int a, int b)` and the corresponding C declaration `extern int asm_add(int a, int b);` and usage."

## Calling C/C++ from Assembly
"Generate content starting at heading level 2 explaining how to call a C or C++ function from assembly language code. Describe the process: 1. Ensure the C/C++ function is externally visible (usually default unless declared `static`). 2. In assembly, use the `BL` instruction to call the C function's label. 3. Before the `BL`, set up arguments according to the AAPCS (e.g., in R0-R3/X0-X7 and/or on the stack). 4. After the `BL`, retrieve the return value according to the AAPCS (e.g., from R0/X0). 5. Be mindful of register preservation rules – the called C function might modify caller-saved registers."
*   "Provide a simple example: calling a C function `int c_func(int x)` from assembly, passing a value in R0 and retrieving the result from R0."

## Inline Assembly
"Generate content starting at heading level 2 describing the use of inline assembly, embedding assembly instructions directly within C/C++ source code. Explain that the syntax is compiler-specific (e.g., GCC/Clang `asm volatile(...)` vs. Arm Compiler `__asm{...}`). Describe the basic structure for GCC/Clang style: `asm volatile("assembly code" : output operands : input operands : clobber list);`. Explain the purpose of the output/input operands (mapping C variables to registers) and the clobber list (telling the compiler which registers or memory are modified). Highlight that inline assembly can be powerful but complex and less portable than separate assembly files."
*   "Provide a simple GCC/Clang inline assembly example, e.g., reading a system register."
*   "Mention potential pitfalls like compiler reordering and interaction with optimization."

Describe them as small, fast memory buffers holding recently accessed data and instructions. Differentiate between instruction cache (I-cache) and data cache (D-cache), and the levels of cache hierarchy (L1 closest/fastest, L3 furthest/slowest). Briefly mention cache coherency issues in multi-core systems and the existence of cache maintenance operations (e.g., cleaning, invalidating) often needed in specific scenarios like DMA or self-modifying code."

## Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)
"Generate content starting at heading level 2 describing the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB). Explain it as a cache specifically for recently used page table entries (virtual-to-physical address translations and permissions) within the MMU.

Mention TLB flushes as necessary operations when page tables are modified."

## Memory Protection
"Generate content starting at heading level 2 focusing on the memory protection capabilities provided by the MMU (or MPU). Explain how the MMU uses information from the page tables (or MPU regions) to enforce access permissions for different memory regions.
