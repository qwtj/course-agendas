Requesting user permissions is a critical aspect of using many of these frameworks.

**Glossary**:
*   **Core Location**: Framework for determining device location, altitude, and orientation.
*   **MapKit**: Framework for embedding maps and map-related services into apps.
*   **Annotation**: (MapKit) A marker placed on a map, typically representing a point of interest.
*   **Core Motion**: Framework for accessing data from the device's motion sensors.
*   **AVFoundation**: Framework for working with audiovisual media.
*   **Photos Framework**: Framework for accessing and managing the user's photo and video library.
*   **UIImagePickerController**: A standard view controller for selecting media from the library or capturing new media with the camera/microphone.
*   **UserNotifications**: Framework for scheduling and handling local and remote notifications.
*   **APNs (Apple Push Notification service)**: The service that routes remote notifications from a provider server to user devices.

**Quiz**: "<prompt> Create a quiz asking about the purpose of Core Location vs. Core Motion, how to add a pin to a map using MapKit, the role of `UIImagePickerController`, and the difference between local and remote notifications."

**Highlight**: **Key Point**: Always request user permission before accessing sensitive data or features like location, camera, photos, and notifications. Clearly explain why the permission is needed in the `Info.plist` description keys.

**Cross-Reference**: See Section I for `Info.plist` basics. See Section VIII for code signing related to capabilities like Push Notifications.

Briefly introduce third-party analytics and crash reporting services (e.g., Firebase Analytics/Crashlytics, Datadog, Sentry)."

**Summary**: This section covered the essential processes involved in distributing an iOS app, including configuration, code signing, using App Store Connect and TestFlight, submitting to the App Store, automating builds with CI/CD, and post-launch monitoring.

**Glossary**:
*   **Bundle Identifier**: A unique reverse-DNS string that identifies an application (e.g., `com.example.myapp`).
*   **Code Signing**: The process of digitally signing code to assure the user of its origin and integrity.
*   **Provisioning Profile**: A file that links developers, devices, and an App ID, authorizing an app to be installed on specific devices or distributed.
*   **Certificate**: A digital document (Development or Distribution) used in code signing to verify the developer's identity.
*   **App Store Connect**: Apple's web portal for managing apps on the App Store and TestFlight.
*   **TestFlight**: Apple's platform for beta testing iOS apps.
*   **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery; practices for automating the software development lifecycle.
*   **Analytics**: Collecting and analyzing data about app usage and user behavior.
*   **Crash Reporting**: Tools and services that automatically capture and report application crashes.

**Quiz**: "<prompt> Create a quiz covering the purpose of a bundle identifier, the role of provisioning profiles, the main function of App Store Connect vs. TestFlight, and the goal of CI/CD."
