# Timeline of Geologic Time Scale #Geology #HistoryOfEarth #Chronology
This mind map outlines the standard divisions of Earth's history based on the geologic time scale, including major events and dating principles. The scale is hierarchical, dividing time into eons, eras, periods, epochs, and ages.

## Principles and Measurement of Geologic Time #Principles #DatingMethods #Stratigraphy
Fundamental concepts and techniques used to establish the geologic time scale.

### Stratigraphy #RockLayers #Sequencing
The study of layered rocks (strata) and their sequence.

#### Principle of Superposition #RelativeDating #Steno
In an undisturbed sequence of sedimentary rocks, the oldest layers are at the bottom and the youngest are at the top.

#### Principle of Original Horizontality #RelativeDating #Steno
Sedimentary layers are initially deposited horizontally. Tilted or folded layers indicate later disturbance.

#### Principle of Lateral Continuity #RelativeDating #Steno
Sedimentary layers originally extend laterally in all directions until they thin out or encounter a barrier.

#### Principle of Cross-Cutting Relationships #RelativeDating #Hutton
Geologic features (like faults or intrusions) that cut across other rocks must be younger than the rocks they cut.

#### Principle of Inclusions #RelativeDating #Lyell
Rock fragments (inclusions) contained within another rock layer are older than the layer hosting them.

#### Principle of Faunal Succession #RelativeDating #Fossils #Smith
Fossil organisms succeed one another in a definite and recognizable order; therefore, any time period can be identified by its fossil content.

#### Unconformities #Gaps #Erosion
Surfaces representing gaps in the geologic record due to erosion or non-deposition.

### Geochronology (Dating Methods) #Dating #AgeDetermination
Methods used to determine the age of rocks and geologic events.

#### Relative Dating #Sequencing #Correlation
Determining the sequence of geologic events without assigning specific numerical ages. Relies on stratigraphic principles and fossils.

#### Absolute Dating (Geochronometry) #NumericAge #Radiometric
Determining specific numerical ages for rocks or events, primarily using radioactive decay.

##### Radiometric Dating #Isotopes #HalfLife
Measures the decay of radioactive isotopes in minerals to calculate the time since the mineral crystallized.
###### Carbon-14 Dating #Recent #OrganicMaterial
Used for dating organic materials up to ~50,000 years old.
###### Potassium-Argon (K-Ar) Dating #VolcanicRock #Minerals
Used for dating potassium-bearing minerals and volcanic rocks.
###### Uranium-Lead (U-Pb) Dating #Zircon #OldRocks
Very reliable method for dating igneous and metamorphic rocks, especially using zircon crystals; effective for very old rocks.
###### Other Radiometric Methods #RbSr #ReOs
Includes Rubidium-Strontium, Rhenium-Osmium, and others used for specific minerals or time ranges.

##### Other Absolute Dating Methods #DatingTechniques
###### Luminescence Dating #Sediments #Heating
Techniques like Thermoluminescence (TL) and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) date the last time sediments were exposed to sunlight or heat.
###### Magnetostratigraphy #Paleomagnetism #Reversals
Using the record of Earth's magnetic field reversals preserved in rocks for correlation and dating.

### Biostratigraphy #Fossils #Correlation
Using fossils, particularly index fossils (widespread, short-lived species), to correlate and date rock layers.

### Chronostratigraphy vs. Geochronology #Units #Terminology
Distinction between rock units defined by time (chronostratigraphic units like Eonothem, Erathem, System, Series, Stage) and the corresponding intervals of geologic time (geochronologic units like Eon, Era, Period, Epoch, Age).
