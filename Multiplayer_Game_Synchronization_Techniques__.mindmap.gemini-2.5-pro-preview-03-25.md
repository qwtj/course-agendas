# Multiplayer Game Synchronization Techniques #Networking #GameDev #Realtime
Overview of methods used to keep game state consistent across multiple players connected over a network.

## Fundamentals of Networked Games #Basics #Concepts #Networking
Core challenges and concepts inherent in synchronizing distributed simulations.

### Latency (Ping) #Latency #NetworkIssue #Performance
The time it takes for data to travel from a client to the server and back. A primary challenge. [3, 4, 6, 12]
High latency makes real-time interaction difficult. [4]

### Jitter #Jitter #NetworkIssue #Performance
The variation in latency over time. Makes prediction harder. [6]

### Bandwidth #Bandwidth #NetworkIssue #Performance
The maximum rate of data transfer across a network. Limits how much data can be sent per unit of time. [3, 4]

### Packet Loss #PacketLoss #NetworkIssue #Reliability
Data packets failing to reach their destination. Requires handling, especially when using UDP.

### Game State #State #Data #Simulation
The collection of all data representing the current status of the game world and its entities (positions, health, score, etc.). [6]

### Events #Events #Data #Actions
Discrete occurrences within the game (e.g., player shoots, item picked up, button pressed). [19]

### Consistency vs. Responsiveness Trade-off #Tradeoffs #Design #UX
The fundamental conflict between ensuring all players see the exact same thing (consistency) and making the local player's actions feel immediate (responsiveness). [8]

## Underlying Network Concepts #Protocols #TransportLayer #Internet
Basic networking technologies relevant to game synchronization.

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) #TCP #Protocol #Reliable
Provides reliable, ordered delivery but can introduce latency due to acknowledgments and retransmissions. [5, 20]
Often used for less time-critical data or in games where reliability outweighs latency concerns (e.g., some turn-based games, MMOs). [5]
Nagle's algorithm should often be disabled to reduce latency. [5]

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol) #UDP #Protocol #Unreliable
Provides faster, connectionless transmission but doesn't guarantee delivery or order. [5, 20]
Preferred for real-time games where low latency is critical; requires implementing custom reliability/ordering if needed. [4, 5]

### IP (Internet Protocol) & Ports #IP #Ports #Addressing
Fundamental addressing mechanism for sending data between machines.

### NAT Traversal #NAT #Connectivity #Firewall
Techniques required for players behind Network Address Translators (routers/firewalls) to connect, especially in P2P architectures.

### Reliable UDP #ReliableUDP #Protocol #Hybrid
Custom protocols built on top of UDP to add reliability, sequencing, or other features needed for games, without the overhead of TCP.

## Core Synchronization Architectures #Architecture #Topology #Design
High-level models for how game clients and potentially servers are connected and share information. [5, 7, 10]

### Client-Server #ClientServer #Architecture #Authoritative
All clients connect to a central server. The server typically holds the authoritative game state. [2, 5, 10, 14]
#### Dedicated Server #DedicatedServer #ClientServer #Infrastructure
A separate machine runs the server simulation, not tied to any player's client. More scalable and secure. [2, 10]
#### Listen Server (Host) #ListenServer #ClientServer #Host
One player's machine acts as both a client and the server for the game session. Simpler setup, but performance/security depends on the host. [2]
#### Authoritative Server #Authoritative #Security #Consistency
The server has the final say on the game state. Clients send inputs, server processes them and sends back resulting state updates. Helps prevent cheating and ensures consistency. [5, 8, 14]
#### Non-Authoritative Server (Dumb Server) #NonAuthoritative #Simplicity
Server might only relay messages or perform minimal validation, with clients having more authority. Easier to implement, but prone to cheating and desync.

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) #P2P #Architecture #DirectConnection
Clients connect directly to each other, without a central authoritative server. [1, 5, 10, 20]
Reduced server infrastructure cost. [10]
Can be harder to synchronize and more vulnerable to cheating if not using deterministic methods. [10, 26]
Often requires NAT traversal techniques.
#### P2P with Relay Server #RelayServer #P2P #Hybrid
Peers still send game data P2P, but a server helps establish connections or relays data if direct connection fails. [14]

### Distributed Authority #DistributedAuthority #Architecture #Hybrid
Authority over different game objects or systems is shared among multiple clients or servers. [1, 2]
Can help with load balancing and latency hiding for specific objects (e.g., player character controlled locally). [1]

### Hybrid Models #Hybrid #Architecture #Flexibility
Combinations of architectures, e.g., using a server for matchmaking and crucial state, but P2P for some real-time data. [10]

## Key Synchronization Strategies #Strategies #Models #Approaches
Fundamental methods for deciding *what* data to send and *how* to keep clients aligned.

### State Synchronization #StateSync #Approach #DataDriven
Focuses on sending the current state of relevant game objects (position, rotation, health, etc.) from the authoritative source (usually server) to clients. [14, 21, 25]
#### How it Works #StateSync #Mechanism
Server periodically sends snapshots of game state to clients. Clients update their local representation. [11]
Doesn't require determinism. [21]
Client only needs to render the received state (or interpolate towards it). [1]
Often used in FPS, action RPGs. [25]
#### Challenges #StateSync #Issues
Can require significant bandwidth if the state is large or changes frequently. [25]
Requires techniques like interpolation/extrapolation on the client for smoothness. [11]

### Input Synchronization #InputSync #Approach #EventDriven
Focuses on sending player inputs (button presses, joystick movements) between clients/server. [14, 21, 25]
#### How it Works #InputSync #Mechanism
Clients send their inputs to the server (or directly to peers). All instances run the simulation locally based on the received inputs. [14]
Requires the game simulation to be deterministic. [11, 13, 14]
#### Challenges #InputSync #Issues
Strict determinism can be hard to achieve (floating point math, physics engines, RNG). [11, 13]
Latency directly impacts responsiveness unless combined with prediction/rollback. [7]

### Deterministic Lockstep #DeterministicLockstep #Strategy #RTS #FightingGames
A specific implementation of input synchronization where the game simulation only advances one 'tick' or 'frame' when inputs from *all* players for that tick have been received. [1, 11, 13, 14, 18]
#### How it Works #DeterministicLockstep #Mechanism
All clients execute the same inputs in the same order, ensuring identical game states. [1, 11, 13]
Requires perfect determinism. [7, 11, 13]
Low bandwidth usage as only inputs are sent. [7, 13]
#### Requirements #DeterministicLockstep #Prerequisites
Bitwise determinism across all participating machines. [13]
Synchronized simulation stepping (the 'lockstep'). [1, 11]
#### Pros & Cons #DeterministicLockstep #Tradeoffs
Pro: Low bandwidth, perfect sync if determinism holds. [7] Con: Sensitive to latency (slowest player dictates pace), determinism is difficult. [7, 18]
#### Use Cases #DeterministicLockstep #Applications
Common in Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games with many units where state sync would be too costly. [1, 11, 13] Used in some fighting games. [13]

## Latency Compensation Techniques #LatencyCompensation #Prediction #Smoothing #UX
Methods to mitigate the perceived effects of network latency, improving player experience. [12, 17, 20]

### Client-Side Prediction (CSP) #CSP #Prediction #Responsiveness
Client simulates its own actions immediately without waiting for server confirmation, predicting the outcome. [1, 4, 7, 22]
Provides immediate responsiveness for the local player. [4]
Server validates the action; if the prediction was wrong, the client state needs correction (snap/rubber-banding). [18]

### Server Reconciliation / Correction #ServerReconciliation #Correction #Authoritative
The process where the server corrects a client's predicted state if it diverges from the server's authoritative state. [4]

### Interpolation #Interpolation #Smoothing #Visuals
Smoothing the visual representation of remote entities by playing back their state slightly delayed, drawing them between two known past states. [11, 15]
Avoids jerky movement from direct state updates but introduces a small visual delay.

### Extrapolation (Lagging) #Extrapolation #Prediction #Visuals
Predicting the future state of remote entities based on their last known state and velocity when updates haven't arrived yet. [15, 21]
Keeps objects moving smoothly but can lead to incorrect predictions and visual corrections (snapping) when the actual update arrives. [15]
Error increases with time, often limited to a short duration. [15]

### Lag Compensation (Time Rewind) #LagCompensation #Shooting #Fairness #RewindTime
Server keeps a short history of past game states (especially player positions). When processing a player action (like shooting), the server rewinds the relevant parts of the world state back in time based on the firing player's latency to see if the shot would have hit based on what that player saw. [7, 9, 15, 22]
Makes aiming feel more accurate for the shooter despite latency. [9]
Can lead to "shot around the corner" scenarios for the victim. [9]
Requires time synchronization between client and server. [9]

### Rollback (e.g., GGPO-style) #Rollback #Prediction #FightingGames #RTS
An extension of deterministic lockstep/input sync used often in fighting games. [7]
Client predicts future frames based on local input and potentially predicted remote input. [1, 7]
If remote input arrives and differs from prediction, the game state "rolls back" to the last confirmed state and re-simulates forward with the correct inputs. [7]
Provides low input latency but requires fast re-simulation and can cause visual hiccups on mispredictions. [18]

## Network Optimization Techniques #Optimization #Bandwidth #Efficiency
Methods to reduce the amount of data sent over the network or improve its handling.

### Data Compression #Compression #Bandwidth #Optimization
Reducing the size of data packets using general or specialized compression algorithms. [4]

### Delta Compression / Delta Encoding #DeltaCompression #StateSync #Optimization
Sending only the *changes* in state since the last acknowledged update, rather than the full state. [1]

### Bit Packing #BitPacking #Bandwidth #LowLevel
Storing data using the minimum number of bits required, rather than standard byte sizes.

### Interest Management / Area of Interest (AoI) #InterestManagement #AoI #Scalability #MMO
Sending clients only the data relevant to their current location or situation (e.g., entities within visual range). Crucial for large worlds like MMOs. [19]

### Prioritization #Prioritization #Bandwidth #QoS
Sending more important updates (e.g., player actions, nearby enemies) more frequently or reliably than less important ones (e.g., distant scenery changes). [1]

### Message Aggregation #Aggregation #Bandwidth #Overhead
Combining multiple small messages into a single larger packet to reduce per-packet overhead.

## Consistency Models #Consistency #State #DataManagement
Rules defining how and when players see updates and whether inconsistencies are allowed temporarily.

### Strong Consistency #StrongConsistency #Determinism #Lockstep
All players are guaranteed to have the exact same view of the game state at the same logical time (e.g., deterministic lockstep). [1]

### Eventual Consistency #EventualConsistency #StateSync #Tradeoffs
Players' views might temporarily diverge, but are guaranteed to converge to the same state over time (common with state synchronization and client prediction).

### Causal Consistency #CausalConsistency #Ordering
Ensures that operations that are causally related are seen in the same order by all participants.

## Security Considerations #Security #AntiCheat #Validation
Addressing cheating and vulnerabilities related to network synchronization.

### Input Validation #InputValidation #Security #AntiCheat
Server rigorously checks client inputs to ensure they are plausible and not exploitative (e.g., preventing speed hacks, impossible actions). [4, 14]

### State Validation #StateValidation #Security #AntiCheat
Server verifies that client-reported state changes are consistent with game rules and server simulation. [14]

### Server Authority #Authoritative #Security #BestPractice
Having a trusted, authoritative server is the primary defense against many forms of cheating. [8, 14]

### Encryption #Encryption #Security #Privacy
Protecting game data in transit from eavesdropping or tampering. [4, 6]

### Anti-Cheat Systems #AntiCheat #Detection #Mitigation
Dedicated software or techniques to detect memory hacking, aimbots, wallhacks, etc., which often exploit or interfere with synchronized state. [3, 4, 6]

## Debugging and Tools #Debugging #Tools #Troubleshooting
