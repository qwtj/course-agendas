Explains how `mod_dav`, `mod_dav_fs`, and `mod_dav_lock` enable Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning, allowing users to manage files on the web server remotely as if they were local.
### Embedded Apache (e.g., `mod_perl`, `mod_python`, `mod_php`) #Embedding #Scripting #Performance
Discusses modules that embed scripting language interpreters (like Perl, Python, PHP via `mod_php`) directly into Apache processes. While offering potential speed benefits in some cases, this approach often has higher memory consumption and potential stability issues compared to FastCGI/proxy setups.
### Event-Driven Architecture (event MPM details) #Async #Performance #Internals
Provides a deeper look into how the event MPM uses non-blocking I/O and a dedicated listener thread to efficiently handle many concurrent (especially keep-alive) connections with fewer resources than traditional models.
