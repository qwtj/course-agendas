# I. Fundamentals of Internal Combustion Engines

## Understanding Engine Components

### Identifying Key Parts

*   Cylinder Head
*   Engine Block
*   Piston
*   Connecting Rod
*   Crankshaft
*   Valves (Intake and Exhaust)
*   Camshaft
*   Spark Plug (for gasoline engines)
*   Fuel Injector (for gasoline engines) or Carburetor

### Function of Each Component

*   Cylinder Head: Contains valves and spark plugs/injectors; seals the cylinder.
*   Engine Block: Houses cylinders, pistons, and coolant passages.
*   Piston: Moves within the cylinder to compress the air-fuel mixture and transmit power.
*   Connecting Rod: Connects the piston to the crankshaft.
*   Crankshaft: Converts reciprocating motion to rotary motion.
*   Valves: Control the flow of air and fuel into, and exhaust out of, the cylinder.
*   Camshaft: Operates the valves.
*   Spark Plug: Ignites the air-fuel mixture (gasoline engines).
*   Fuel Injector/Carburetor: Delivers fuel to the engine.

## Understanding the Four-Stroke Cycle (Otto Cycle)

### Intake Stroke

*   Piston moves down, creating a vacuum.
*   Intake valve opens, allowing air-fuel mixture to enter the cylinder.

### Compression Stroke

*   Intake valve closes.
*   Piston moves up, compressing the air-fuel mixture.

### Combustion (Power) Stroke

*   Spark plug ignites the compressed mixture.
*   Rapid expansion of gases forces the piston down.

### Exhaust Stroke

*   Exhaust valve opens.
*   Piston moves up, pushing exhaust gases out of the cylinder.

## Understanding Basic Engine Terminology

### Bore and Stroke

*   Bore: Diameter of the cylinder.
*   Stroke: Distance the piston travels in the cylinder.

### Displacement

*   Calculated as `Ï€ * (Bore/2)^2 * Stroke * Number of Cylinders`

### Compression Ratio

*   Ratio of cylinder volume at the bottom dead center (BDC) to the top dead center (TDC).

### Horsepower and Torque

*   Horsepower: Measure of the rate at which work is done.
*   Torque: Measure of twisting force.
*   Relationship: `Horsepower = (Torque * RPM) / 5252`

*   Advantages of fuel injection over carburetion.

## Understanding Ignition Systems

### Conventional Ignition Systems

*   Distributor, ignition coil, points, condenser.
*   Operation: Points open and close, triggering the coil to generate a high-voltage spark.
*   Drawbacks of conventional systems.

*   Manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor.
*   Oxygen (O2) sensor.

*   Fuel injectors.
*   Ignition coils.
*   Idle air control (IAC) valve.
*   Variable valve timing (VVT) solenoids.

## Understanding Feedback Control Loops

### Open-Loop vs. Closed-Loop Operation

*   Open-loop: ECU relies on pre-programmed maps.
*   Closed-loop: ECU uses sensor feedback to adjust parameters.

### Lambda Control (Air-Fuel Ratio)

*   Stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (14.7:1 for gasoline).
*   Oxygen sensor feedback and lambda correction.
*   Fuel trims (short-term and long-term).

## Understanding Engine Diagnostics

### Reading Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs)

*   Troubleshooting common DTCs.

### Using a Multimeter

*   Testing sensors and actuators.
