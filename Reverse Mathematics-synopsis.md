Learning Objectives: Understand the goals, systems, and applications of Reverse Mathematics; classify logical formulas and theorems based on their computational and proof-theoretic strength.

Prerequisites: Basic mathematical logic, including propositional and first-order logic; familiarity with computability theory and set theory.

Depth & Scope: Overview to intermediate; focus on foundational systems and their applications in analysis and algebra.

Target Audience: Graduate students or researchers in logic, foundations of mathematics, or theoretical computer science.

Technical Details: Examples of Turing machine constructions, arithmetical reductions, and proofs within specific subsystems of second-order arithmetic (e.g., WKL₀, ACA₀, Π¹₁-CA).

Relevant Technologies/Tools: Formal proof systems (e.g., Natural Deduction), Second-Order Arithmetic.

Preferred Format/Length: Detailed explanations with concise examples.
