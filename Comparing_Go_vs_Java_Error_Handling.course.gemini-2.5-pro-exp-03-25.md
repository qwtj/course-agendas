### 1. Java (Exceptions)
*   **Strengths:** "<prompt>List potential strengths of Java's exception handling (e.g., separating error code from main logic, compile-time safety via checked exceptions, established patterns). Define the prompt that will be used to generate this bullet's content with an LLM capturing the context of main topic Comparing Go vs Java Error Handling and parent topics Comparative Summary and Conclusion and Strengths and Weaknesses."</prompt>
*   **Weaknesses:** "<prompt>List potential weaknesses of Java's exception handling (e.g., potential for hidden control flow, verbosity of try-catch, debate around checked exceptions, performance cost of exception creation). Define the prompt that will be used to generate this bullet's content with an LLM capturing the context of main topic Comparing Go vs Java Error Handling and parent topics Comparative Summary and Conclusion and Strengths and Weaknesses."</prompt>

### 2. Go (Error Values)
*   **Strengths:** "<prompt>List potential strengths of Go's error handling (e.g., explicitness, errors as regular values, simpler control flow, generally lower performance overhead for common cases, encouragement of immediate handling). Define the prompt that will be used to generate this bullet's content with an LLM capturing the context of main topic Comparing Go vs Java Error Handling and parent topics Comparative Summary and Conclusion and Strengths and Weaknesses."</prompt>
*   **Weaknesses:** "<prompt>List potential weaknesses of Go's error handling (e.g., verbosity of `if err != nil`, lack of compile-time enforcement, potential to ignore errors easily, `panic/recover` being less integrated for general errors). Define the prompt that will be used to generate this bullet's content with an LLM capturing the context of main topic Comparing Go vs Java Error Handling and parent topics Comparative Summary and Conclusion and Strengths and Weaknesses."</prompt>

## C. Concluding Thoughts
"<prompt>Provide a concluding paragraph summarizing the trade-offs and suggesting that the 'better' approach often depends on project context, team preference, and specific requirements.
