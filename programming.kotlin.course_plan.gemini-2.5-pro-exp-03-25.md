    "<llm_prompt>Starting as a list item, provide a basic Kotlin code example using 'launch' and the suspending function 'delay'.</llm_prompt>"
    
```kotlin
    import kotlinx.coroutines.*

    // Requires a CoroutineScope, e.g., inside runBlocking or another coroutine
    fun main() = runBlocking { // Creates a scope and runs the coroutine
        launch { // Launch a new coroutine in the scope
            delay(1000L) // Suspending function, non-blocking wait
            println("World!")
        }
        println("Hello,")
        // runBlocking waits for the launched coroutine to complete

#### Handling Jobs & Cancellation
"<llm_prompt>Starting at heading level 4, explain that a `Job` represents a cancellable piece of work. Describe the parent-child relationship between jobs created within a scope and how cancellation propagates.

            val deferred1 = async { doWork(1) }

### Using Annotation Processing
"<llm_prompt>Starting at heading level 3, explain annotation processing as a compile-time metaprogramming technique used to generate source code based on annotations present in the codebase. Introduce the Kotlin Annotation Processing Tool (KAPT) for interoperability with Java annotation processors and the newer, Kotlin-first Kotlin Symbol Processing API (KSP) for better performance.</llm_prompt>"
*   **Glossary Term:** Annotation
 Processing, KAPT, KSP
    "<llm_prompt>Starting as a list item, define 'Annotation Processing', 'KAPT', and 'KSP'.</llm_prompt>"

### Applying Reflection
"<llm_prompt>Starting at heading level 3, expand on the basic introduction to reflection (Section VIII). Discuss using the `kotlin-reflect` library for more advanced runtime introspection and manipulation of code structure. Reiterate the potential performance costs and limitations on certain platforms.</llm_prompt>"
*   **Improving Techniques/Metaprogramming:**
    "<llm_prompt>Starting as a list item, position reflection and annotation processing as metaprogramming techniques available in Kotlin.</llm_prompt>"

"<llm_prompt>Starting at heading level 3, explain the `typealias` keyword, which allows creating alternative names for existing types (including complex generic types or function types). Discuss how type aliases can improve code readability and simplify declarations.</llm_prompt>"
*   **Example:** Type Alias
    "<llm_prompt>Starting as a list item, provide a Kotlin code example demonstrating the use of 'typealias' for a function type or a complex generic type.</llm_prompt>"
    
```kotlin
    typealias UserMap = Map<String, User> // Alias for a complex generic type
    typealias ClickHandler = (viewId: Int) -> Unit // Alias for a function type

    fun processUsers(users: UserMap) { /* ... */ }
    fun setClickListener(handler: ClickHandler) { /* ... */ }

    // Assuming User data class exists from Section IV
    data class User(val name: String, val age: Int)
    ```


### Implementing Delegation
"<llm_prompt>Starting at heading level 3, explain Kotlin's first-class support for the delegation pattern using the `by` keyword. Differentiate between class delegation (delegating interface implementation to another object) and delegated properties (delegating property accessor logic to another object, e.g., `lazy`, `observable`, custom delegates).
