# C++ Assertions #Overview #Debugging #CoreConcept
Assertions are checks embedded in code to verify assumptions about the program's state, primarily used during development and debugging.

## Introduction to Assertions #Fundamentals #Basics #Motivation
Understanding the core purpose and benefits of using assertions in C++.
### What are Assertions? #Definition #Concept
Statements that check if a condition expected to be true at a certain point in the program is indeed true. If the condition is false, the assertion triggers an error, often terminating the program.
### Why Use Assertions? #Benefits #Rationale
- Early bug detection during development.
- Documenting programmer assumptions and invariants.
- Verifying internal consistency and logic.
- Aiding debugging by pinpointing where assumptions fail.
### Assertions vs. Regular Code #Distinction #Comparison
Assertions check for *programmer errors* (bugs), not expected runtime errors (like invalid user input). They typically can be disabled in production builds.

## Standard Library `assert` Macro #CStandardLibrary #RuntimeCheck #Macro
The traditional C-style assertion mechanism available via `<cassert>` or `<assert.h>`.
### Syntax and Usage #Syntax #Example
```
cpp
#include <cassert>
// ...
assert(condition);

```
If `condition` evaluates to false, an implementation-defined diagnostic message is printed to `stderr`, and `std::abort()` is called.
### Behavior in Debug vs. Release Builds #BuildConfiguration #NDEBUG
- **Debug:** `assert` checks are active.
- **Release:** If the macro `NDEBUG` (No Debug) is defined before including `<cassert>`, `assert` statements expand to nothing (effectively removed).
### Header File #Include #Dependency
Requires including `<cassert>` (C++ style) or `<assert.h>` (C style).
### Limitations #Drawbacks #Considerations
- Runtime check only.
- Can be disabled entirely via `NDEBUG`.
- Standard diagnostic message might lack context.
- Potential for side effects if the condition expression has them (should be avoided).

## Compile-Time Assertions (`static_assert`) #CompileTimeCheck #TypeSystem #Templates
Assertions evaluated during compilation, introduced in C++11 and enhanced in C++17.
### `static_assert` (C++11) #Syntax #C++11
```
cpp
static_assert(constant_expression, "Error message string literal");

```
Triggers a compile-time error with the specified message if `constant_expression` is false.
### `static_assert` (C++17) #Syntax #C++17 #Enhancement
```
cpp
static_assert(constant_expression); // Message is optional

```
Allows omitting the error message string literal.
### Use Cases #Application #Examples
- Validating template parameters (`std::is_integral<T>::value`).
- Checking sizes of types (`sizeof(int) == 4`).
- Ensuring struct/class layout assumptions.
- Verifying constexpr function results at compile time.
- Preventing instantiation of templates under invalid conditions.
### Benefits #Advantages #CompileTime
- Catches errors earlier in the development cycle (at compile time).
- No runtime overhead.
- Cannot be disabled by `NDEBUG`.
- Improves template metaprogramming safety.

## Controlling Assertions #Configuration #BuildSystem #NDEBUG
Mechanisms to enable or disable standard runtime assertions.
### The `NDEBUG` Macro #Macro #Standard
Defining `NDEBUG` before including `<cassert>` disables all `assert` macros in that translation unit.
### Build System Integration #CMake #Make #BuildFlags
Typically controlled via compiler flags (`-DNDEBUG`) set by the build system (CMake, Make, etc.) for release configurations.
### Conditional Compilation #Preprocessor #Ifdef
Using `#ifndef NDEBUG` / `#endif` for custom debug-only code blocks, sometimes related to assertions.

## Best Practices for Using Assertions #Guidelines #EffectiveUse #CodingStyle
Recommendations for writing effective and maintainable assertions.
### Assert Preconditions #Precondition #FunctionContract
Verify function input requirements that are the caller's responsibility.
```
cpp
void processPointer(int* ptr) {
  assert(ptr != nullptr && "Caller must provide a non-null pointer.");
  // ... use ptr ...
}

```
### Assert Postconditions #Postcondition #FunctionContract
Verify conditions that should be true upon function exit, assuming preconditions were met.
```
cpp
double calculateSqrt(double x) {
  assert(x >= 0.0 && "Input must be non-negative.");
  double result = /* ... calculation ... */;
  assert(result >= 0.0 && "Result must be non-negative.");
  // Optional: Check closeness for floating-point
  assert(std::abs(result * result - x) < 1e-9 && "Result squared should approximate input.");
  return result;
}


```
### Assert Invariants #Invariant #ClassConsistency #ObjectState
Verify internal state consistency within a class method or loop.
```
cpp
class BoundedBuffer {
  // ...
  void push(int item) {
    assert(count < capacity && "Buffer cannot be full before push.");
    // ... push logic ...
    assert(count > 0 && "Buffer cannot be empty after push.");
    assert(count <= capacity && "Buffer cannot exceed capacity after push.");
  }
  // Class invariant check method
  void checkInvariant() const {
      assert(count >= 0);
      assert(count <= capacity);
      // ... other invariant checks ...
  }
};

```
### Avoid Side Effects in Assertion Conditions #SideEffects #Pitfall #Warning
The condition expression within `assert` should not modify program state, as it might be compiled out.
```
cpp
// BAD: Modifies x, behavior changes if NDEBUG is defined
assert(++x > 0);

// GOOD: Check state without modifying it
int next_val = x + 1;
assert(next_val > 0);
x = next_val; // Modify state separately

```
### Write Clear Assertion Messages #Clarity #Readability #DebuggingAid
Although `assert` lacks a standard message parameter, `static_assert` and custom frameworks benefit greatly from descriptive failure messages.
### Don't Use Assertions for Expected Error Handling #ErrorHandling #Distinction
Assertions check for *bugs*. Use exceptions, error codes, or other mechanisms for handling predictable runtime errors (e.g., file not found, invalid user input).

## Assertions vs. Error Handling #Comparison #DesignChoice #Robustness
Understanding the distinct roles of assertions and runtime error handling mechanisms.
### Purpose Distinction #BugDetection #RuntimeErrors
- Assertions: Detect impossible/logic-violating situations (bugs). Intended for developers. Assume they won't trigger in correct code.
- Error Handling: Manage expected but potentially problematic runtime situations (e.g., network failure, invalid input). Intended for robust operation.
### Target Audience #Developer #EndUser
- Assertions: Failures indicate programming errors needing fixes. Messages target developers.
- Error Handling: Failures indicate runtime issues. Messages/recovery mechanisms might target end-users or system administrators.
### Production Builds #RuntimeBehavior #NDEBUG
- Assertions: Often disabled in production for performance. Failure usually means termination.
- Error Handling: Must remain active in production. Aims for graceful recovery or informative reporting.
### Mechanisms #Exceptions #ReturnCodes #Assertions
Comparing `assert` with `throw`, `std::optional`, `std::expected` (C++23), return codes, etc.

## Assertions in Debugging and Testing #Debugging #Testing #QualityAssurance
How assertions contribute to finding and fixing bugs and ensuring code quality.
### Pinpointing Bug Locations #Localization #DebuggingAid
Failed assertions immediately point to the location where an invariant or assumption was violated.
### Relationship with Unit Testing #UnitTesting #Integration
- Assertions within code under test can catch issues during unit test execution.
- Unit testing frameworks often have their own assertion macros (e.g., `ASSERT_TRUE` in Google Test) which serve a similar purpose but are specific to the test environment and provide richer reporting.
### Integration Testing #SystemTesting #Validation
Assertions can help validate component interactions and system-wide invariants during integration and system tests.

## Custom Assertion Handlers and Frameworks #Customization #Libraries #Advanced
Going beyond the standard `assert` and `static_assert`.
### Defining Custom `assert` Behavior #Handler #ImplementationDefined
Some platforms/compilers might allow redefining assertion behavior, though it's often non-standard.
### Assertion Libraries #BoostAssert #GoogleTest #Catch2
Libraries offering more features:
- Custom messages.
- Different severity levels (warning, error).
- Integration with logging.
- Conditional enabling/disabling beyond just `NDEBUG`.
- Richer reporting on failure.
### Benefits of Custom Frameworks #Advantages #Flexibility
More control, better diagnostics, potential for different actions on failure (log, throw, debug break).

## Advanced Topics and Considerations #Advanced #Performance #Contracts
Deeper aspects related to assertion usage.
### Performance Impact #Overhead #RuntimeCost
Runtime assertions (`assert`) incur a cost (evaluating the condition). This is why they are often disabled in release builds (`NDEBUG`). `static_assert` has no runtime cost.
### Assertions and Contracts (C++20 onwards) #Contracts #C++20 #Future
C++20 introduced contract programming features (`[[expects]]`, `[[ensures]]`, `[[assert]]`) which formalize preconditions, postconditions, and assertions. They offer more structure and potentially different build modes (e.g., checks on, checks off, audit mode). Note: Compiler/standard library support is still evolving.
### Assertions in `constexpr` Contexts #Constexpr #CompileTime
Using `assert` within `constexpr` functions (since C++14/17 depending on context) can enforce checks during compile-time evaluation if the function is invoked in a constant expression context. `static_assert` is generally preferred for purely compile-time checks.
### Assertions and Undefined Behavior #UB #Safety
Assertions can be used to check conditions that, if false, might lead to undefined behavior (e.g., checking array indices before access, checking pointers before dereferencing).

## Alternatives and Related Concepts #Alternatives #ErrorHandling #Logging
Other techniques used alongside or instead of assertions.
### Exceptions #ExceptionHandling #ErrorHandling
Used for handling runtime errors that can reasonably occur and potentially be recovered from.
### Return Codes / Status Flags #ErrorCodes #StatusReporting
Traditional C-style error reporting, often used in performance-critical code or C APIs.
### `std::optional` / `std::expected` #ModernCpp #ErrorHandling
Modern C++ ways to represent potential absence of a value or an error state without exceptions.
### Logging #Logging #Diagnostics
Recording program execution details, which can include warnings or errors less severe than assertion failures. Assertions often trigger before logging the fatal error.
