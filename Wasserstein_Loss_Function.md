# I. Introduction to Optimal Transport

## Understanding Optimal Transport (OT)

### Defining Optimal Transport
*   Concept of transporting mass from a source distribution to a target distribution.
*   Minimizing the cost of this transport.

### Mathematical Formulation of OT
*   Source and target probability distributions: `μ` and `ν`.
*   Cost function: `c(x, y)` (e.g., squared Euclidean distance).
*   Transport plan `γ(x, y)`: A joint distribution representing the amount of mass transported from `x` to `y`.
*   OT problem: Minimize `∫ c(x, y) dγ(x, y)` subject to `∫ γ(x, y) dy = μ(x)` and `∫ γ(x, y) dx = ν(y)`.

## Introduction to the Wasserstein Distance

### Defining the Wasserstein Distance (Earth Mover's Distance)
*   The minimal cost of transporting one distribution to another.
*   Formally: `W_p(μ, ν) = (inf_{γ ∈ Γ(μ, ν)} ∫ c(x, y)^p dγ(x, y))^{1/p}`, where `Γ(μ, ν)` represents all joint distributions with marginals `μ` and `ν`.

### Understanding Different Orders of Wasserstein Distance
*   `W_1`:  The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) or Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance.
*   `W_2`:  Commonly used with squared Euclidean distance as the cost function.

### Properties of Wasserstein Distance
*   Metric properties: Non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry, and triangle inequality.
*   Robustness to noise and outliers compared to other divergence measures.

# II. Wasserstein Loss Function

## Defining the Wasserstein Loss

### Wasserstein Loss as a Cost Function
*   Using the Wasserstein distance as a loss function in machine learning tasks.
*   Comparing the predicted distribution to the true distribution.

### Formulation of the Wasserstein Loss
*   Given a model prediction `P` and a target distribution `T`, the Wasserstein loss is `W(P, T)`.
*   Example: Minimizing `W_2(P, T)` where `P` represents the predicted distribution and `T` the true distribution.

## Advantages of Using Wasserstein Loss

### Handling Non-Overlapping Distributions
*   Addresses the issue of zero gradients when distributions have non-overlapping support.
*   Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can fail when the support of P doesn't overlap with T.

### Providing Meaningful Gradients
*   Gradients guide the model towards regions where the distributions align.
*   Improved training stability in some cases.

### Robustness to Mode Collapse
*   In generative models, Wasserstein loss can mitigate mode collapse by encouraging the generator to cover the entire data distribution.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Computational Complexity
*   Calculating the exact Wasserstein distance can be computationally expensive, especially in high dimensions.
*   Approximation methods are often required.

### Implementation Complexity
*   Requires specific algorithms and solvers (e.g., Sinkhorn algorithm) for calculating Wasserstein distance.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
*   The choice of cost function (`c(x, y)`) and the order `p` (e.g., `W_1`, `W_2`) can significantly impact performance.

# III. Practical Implementation and Examples

## Implementing Wasserstein Loss in Python

### Using Libraries: `POT` (Python Optimal Transport)
*   Installation: `pip install POT`
*   Example using `POT` library for computing Wasserstein distance:
    ```python
    import ot
    import numpy as np

    # Define two discrete probability distributions
    mu = np.array([1/3, 1/3, 1/3])
    nu = np.array([1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4])

    # Define the cost matrix
    M = ot.dist(np.arange(3).reshape((3, 1)), np.arange(4).reshape((4, 1)))

    # Compute the Wasserstein distance
    W1 = ot.emd2(mu, nu, M)  # ot.emd2 returns the distance, not the transport plan.

    print(f"Wasserstein distance: {W1}")
    ```

### Implementing Wasserstein Loss in TensorFlow/PyTorch

*   Using approximation methods like the Sinkhorn algorithm.
*   Example implementation in PyTorch:

    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn.functional as F

    def sinkhorn(P, Q, cost, reg, num_iter=10):
        # P,Q : (batch_size, num_bins)
        # cost : (num_bins, num_bins)
        # reg : regularization strength

        u = torch.ones_like(P) / P.shape[1]
        v = torch.ones_like(Q) / Q.shape[1]

        for i in range(num_iter):
            v = Q / torch.sum(torch.exp(log_M(cost, u, v, reg)), dim=1, keepdim=True)
            u = P / torch.sum(torch.exp(log_M(cost, u, v, reg)), dim=1, keepdim=True)
        return torch.sum(torch.exp(log_M(cost, u, v, reg)) * cost, dim=(1,2))

    def log_M(cost, u, v, reg):
        return (-cost + torch.log(u.unsqueeze(2)) + torch.log(v.unsqueeze(1))) / reg
    ```

## Application Examples

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
*   Using Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) to improve training stability and avoid mode collapse.
*   Replacing the discriminator loss with the Wasserstein distance (or a related approximation like the Earth Mover's distance).

### Domain Adaptation
*   Minimizing the Wasserstein distance between feature distributions of source and target domains.
*   Encouraging the model to learn domain-invariant features.

### Image and Signal Processing
*   Measuring the similarity between images or signals based on the Wasserstein distance.
*   Applications in image retrieval and classification.
