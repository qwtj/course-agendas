# Comparing Vue Versions #VueJS #Comparison #Framework
This mind map provides a comprehensive comparison between major Vue.js versions, focusing primarily on Vue 2 vs Vue 3.

## Overall Architecture & Design Philosophy #Core #Design
Focuses on the fundamental shifts in how Vue applications are structured and built between versions.
### Vue 2 Architecture #OptionsAPI #InstanceCentric
Relied heavily on the Options API, where component logic is organized by option types (data, methods, computed, etc.) within a component instance (`this`). [15, 6]
Often led to challenges in organizing and reusing logic in large components or across multiple components, sometimes addressed with Mixins. [11]
### Vue 3 Architecture #CompositionAPI #Modular #Flexible
Introduced the Composition API as a primary, more flexible way to organize logic by feature or concern, rather than by option type. [4, 5, 6, 12]
Promotes better logic reuse through Composable functions, addressing limitations of Mixins. [11, 12]
Designed to be more modular, allowing for better tree-shaking and smaller core runtime. [5, 21]
The Options API is still fully supported in Vue 3 and is implemented on top of the Composition API. [1, 11, 26]
Vue 3 allows multiple root elements in a component template (Fragments), removing the need for single wrapper elements often required in Vue 2. [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]

## Reactivity System #Reactivity #Internals
Details the changes in how Vue tracks state changes and updates the DOM.
### Vue 2 Reactivity (Object.defineProperty) #GettersSetters #Limitations
Used `Object.defineProperty` to track changes. [4]
Had limitations, especially with detecting array mutations and adding new properties to reactive objects. [4]
Could be less performant for deep reactivity tracking. [4]
### Vue 3 Reactivity (Proxy) #ProxyBased #Performance #Improvements
Uses ES6 Proxies for reactivity. [4, 22]
Provides more robust and performant reactivity tracking, overcoming limitations of `Object.defineProperty`. [4, 5]
Supports deep reactivity more efficiently. [4]
Offers `shallowRef` and `shallowReactive` for performance tuning by limiting reactivity depth. [27]
Vue 3.5 introduced significant reactivity system optimizations for better performance and reduced memory usage (up to 56% less). [10, 14, 19]

## Performance Enhancements #Performance #Optimization
Highlights the speed and efficiency gains in Vue 3.
### Vue 2 Performance #VDOM #OptimizationNeeded
Generally performant, but could require manual optimizations in complex scenarios. [1]
Virtual DOM implementation was less optimized compared to Vue 3. [21]
### Vue 3 Performance #FasterVDOM #TreeShaking #Memory
Offers significant performance improvements over Vue 2. [1, 4, 5, 13, 21]
Faster Virtual DOM implementation with optimized updates and static tree hoisting. [4, 21, 22]
Improved rendering performance, reducing unnecessary updates. [22, 27]
Smaller bundle sizes due to increased modularity and better tree-shaking support. [1, 5, 13, 21, 22]
Reported improvements: up to 55% faster initial render, 133% faster updates, significantly less memory usage. [13]
Vue 3.5 further optimized reactivity, leading to up to 10x faster operations on large reactive arrays and reduced memory footprint. [10, 14, 19]

## Composition API vs Options API #API #Composition #Organization
Compares the two primary ways of writing component logic.
### Options API (Vue 2 Default, Vue 3 Supported) #Structured #BeginnerFriendly #ClassBased
Organizes code by options: `data`, `methods`, `computed`, `watch`, lifecycle hooks. [4, 6, 15]
Often considered easier for beginners or those from OOP backgrounds due to its structured nature centered around `this`. [11, 15, 26]
Can become difficult to manage in large components where logical concerns are split across multiple options. [3, 12]
Primary mechanism for logic reuse was Mixins, which have drawbacks (naming collisions, unclear source). [11]
### Composition API (Vue 3 Introduced, Vue 2.7 Backported) #Functional #Flexible #Reusable
Allows organizing code by logical concerns using imported functions (`setup`, `ref`, `computed`, etc.). [1, 4, 6, 7, 11]
Enables cleaner, more efficient logic reuse via Composable functions. [11, 12]
More flexible and scalable, especially for complex components. [5, 11, 12, 15]
Better suited for TypeScript integration due to improved type inference. [7, 9, 11]
Typically used with `<script setup>` syntax sugar in SFCs for less boilerplate. [2, 11, 26]
Can have a steeper learning curve for those unfamiliar with functional/reactive programming. [23]
Leads to smaller bundle sizes due to better minification possibilities. [11, 23]

## New Features & Capabilities (Vue 3 Specific) #Features #Vue3 #Enhancements
Lists significant additions introduced in Vue 3.
### Teleport #DOMManipulation #Portal
Built-in component to render content in a different part of the DOM, outside the component's hierarchy. [1, 4, 7]
Useful for modals, notifications, tooltips. [4]
Vue 3.5 introduced Deferred Teleport, allowing teleporting to targets that may not exist at mount time. [10]
### Fragments #Template #MultipleRoots
Allows components to have multiple root nodes in their template. [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]
Eliminates the need for unnecessary wrapper `<div>` elements. [6]
### Suspense (Experimental) #Async #LoadingState
Component for orchestrating async dependencies, handling loading states and fallbacks. [1, 2, 7]
Allows showing fallback content (e.g., spinners) while waiting for async components or data. [7]
### Emits Option #Events #Declaration
Explicit `emits` option for declaring events a component can emit. [2]
Improves component contract clarity and type checking (with TypeScript).
### `<script setup>` Syntax Sugar #DX #CompositionAPI
Compile-time syntax sugar for using Composition API inside Single-File Components (SFCs). [2, 11]
Reduces boilerplate, making Composition API usage more concise. [11, 26]
### SFC State-Driven CSS Variables (`v-bind` in `<style>`) #CSS #DynamicStyles
Allows binding component state directly to CSS variables within SFC `<style>` tags. [2, 7]
### Custom Renderer API #Extensibility #Platform
Provides `createRenderer` API for creating custom renderers targeting different environments (e.g., native, canvas). [2]
### Lifecycle Hook Changes #Hooks #API
Some lifecycle hook names changed (e.g., `destroyed` -> `unmounted`). [7]
Composition API introduces lifecycle hooks usable within `setup()` (e.g., `onMounted`, `onUnmounted`). [3]
### Multiple `v-model`s #TwoWayBinding #Flexibility
Allows defining multiple `v-model` bindings on a single component. [7, 33]
### Reactive Props Destructure (Vue 3.5+) #Props #Reactivity #DX
Allows destructuring props from `defineProps` in `<script setup>` while retaining reactivity, simplifying default value declaration. [10, 14]
### `useId()` (Vue 3.5+) #SSR #Accessibility
Composable providing unique, SSR-stable IDs for accessibility attributes. [10, 14]
### `useTemplateRef()` (Vue 3.5+) #Refs #DX
Simplified syntax for template refs, potentially with auto-inference in SFCs. [10, 14, 31]

## Breaking Changes & Deprecations #BreakingChanges #Migration #Compatibility
Outlines significant changes from Vue 2 that require code modification for Vue 3 compatibility.
### Global API Changes #Initialization #Mounting
Global Vue instance (`new Vue()`) replaced by application instances created via `createApp()`. [2, 4]
Global configurations (plugins, mixins, components) are scoped to the application instance. [2, 4]
### `v-model` Changes #TwoWayBinding #API
Internal mechanism changed; requires adjustments for custom components using `v-model`. [2]
Prop name (`value` -> `modelValue`) and event name (`input` -> `update:modelValue`) changed by default.
### Functional Components #Components #Performance
`functional` attribute/option removed; functional components now created as plain functions. [2, 17]
### Render Function API Changes #Render #hFunction
Changes to the `h()` function arguments and VNode structure. [2]
### Filters Removed #Filters #Deprecated
Filters (`| filterName`) are removed in Vue 3. [7] Recommended replacements include computed properties or methods.
### Event API Changes #Events #Native
`$on`, `$off`, `$once` instance methods removed. Event Hub pattern needs alternative implementation.
`$children` removed.
`.native` modifier for `v-on` removed.
### Attribute Coercion Behavior #Attributes #Templates
Changes in how boolean attributes and attribute bindings are coerced. [2]
### `v-if` / `v-for` Precedence #Directives #Templates
Precedence changed when used on the same element. Vue 3 `v-if` has higher precedence.
### `keyCode` Modifiers for `v-on` Removed #Events #Keyboard
Removed in favor of named key aliases (e.g., `@keyup.enter`). [2]
### Others #MinorChanges
Various other minor changes documented in the official migration guide. [2]

## TypeScript Integration #TypeScript #Typing #DX
Compares the level and quality of TypeScript support.
### Vue 2 TypeScript Support #Limited #CommunityEffort
Had limited built-in TypeScript support, often requiring class components (`vue-class-component`) or community libraries for better integration. [4, 5]
Type inference could be less robust. [4, 18]
### Vue 3 TypeScript Support #FirstClass #Improved #Rewritten
Vue 3 core is written in TypeScript, offering first-class TS support. [1, 8, 18, 22]
Provides significantly improved type inference, especially with Composition API. [4, 5, 7, 22]
Better tooling support (e.g., Vue - Official VS Code extension, formerly Volar). [8]
Allows defining props and emits with type-based declarations using `defineProps` and `defineEmits` generics. [31, 32]
Official libraries (Vue Router, Pinia/Vuex) updated with improved TS support. [21]
Vue 3.3+ improved ergonomics, e.g., allowing imported types in `defineProps`/`defineEmits`. [31, 32]
Some complexities remain, especially around template type checking and complex generic types. [30, 31]

## Build Tools & Ecosystem #Build #Tooling #Ecosystem
Discusses changes in recommended build setups and the surrounding library ecosystem.
### Vue 2 Ecosystem #VueCLI #Webpack #Maturity
Primarily used Vue CLI (based on Webpack). [5, 8]
Mature ecosystem, but some libraries might not have straightforward Vue 3 upgrade paths. [5, 16]
Vuex was the standard state management library. [9]
### Vue 3 Ecosystem #Vite #ESBuild #Modernization
Vite is the recommended build tool, offering significantly faster cold server starts and Hot Module Replacement (HMR). [8, 9, 28]
Vue CLI can still be used but Vite is preferred. [8]
Improved tooling like Vue - Official (Volar) for better IDE/TS support. [8, 28]
Pinia is the recommended state management library, offering a simpler API and better TS support than Vuex. [9, 28]
Nuxt 3 (meta-framework) rebuilt for Vue 3, leveraging Vite and Composition API. [9]
Ecosystem migration took time, but most major libraries now support Vue 3. [5, 9, 16]
Tree-shaking is more effective due to Vue 3's modular design. [5, 21, 22]

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR) #SSR #ServerSide #Performance
Comparison of SSR capabilities and performance.
### Vue 2 SSR #Nuxt2 #PerformanceConsiderations
Supported SSR, commonly via Nuxt 2.
Performance could sometimes be a bottleneck. [33]
### Vue 3 SSR #Nuxt3 #ViteSSR #Improvements
Improved SSR performance. [33]
Leverages Vite's SSR features.
Nuxt 3 offers enhanced SSR capabilities built on Vue 3.
Vue 3.5 introduced SSR improvements like lazy hydration and `useId()` for stable IDs. [10, 14, 19]

## Developer Experience (DX) #DX #Development #Tooling
Focuses on the overall experience of developing with each version.
### Vue 2 DX #OptionsAPI #Simplicity #VueCLI
Options API often seen as simpler for basic components. [15]
Vue CLI provided a standardized project setup.
Debugging could sometimes be less straightforward with Mixins.
### Vue 3 DX #CompositionAPI #Vite #TypeScript #Flexibility
Composition API offers better organization for complex logic. [5, 12]
Vite significantly improves build/dev server speed. [9, 28]
Enhanced TypeScript support improves code safety and maintainability. [1, 5, 21]
Improved debugging capabilities with better tooling integration. [5]
`<script setup>` reduces boilerplate for Composition API. [2, 11]

## Migration Strategies #Migration #Upgrade #Compatibility
Covers approaches for moving from Vue 2 to Vue 3.
### Migration Path #Gradual #CompatibilityBuild
Vue 3 offers a Migration Build (`@vue/compat`) that provides Vue 2 compatible APIs on top of Vue 3 runtime. [2, 16, 17, 25]
This allows for a gradual migration by running a Vue 2 app in Vue 3 with warnings for deprecated/changed APIs. [16, 25]
The general process involves: updating dependencies, using the migration build, fixing compile/runtime errors, addressing compatibility warnings, and finally removing the migration build. [17, 25]
### Key Migration Steps #Checklist #Process
Update build tooling (consider migrating from Vue CLI/Webpack to Vite). [8]
Update Vue and add `@vue/compat`. [17, 20, 25]
Alias `vue` to `@vue/compat` in build config. [17]
Address breaking changes (Global API, `v-model`, slots, render functions, filters, etc.). [2, 17, 20]
Update dependencies (Vue Router, Vuex/Pinia, UI libraries) to Vue 3 compatible versions. [17]
Refactor code to remove reliance on removed APIs or changed behaviors. [17, 20]
Consider leveraging Composition API for new features or refactoring complex components.
Automated tools or scripts (including AI-assisted ones) can help with repetitive changes. [29]
### Challenges #Ecosystem #Complexity
Migration can be complex, especially for large applications or those heavily reliant on third-party Vue 2 libraries that lack Vue 3 versions. [16, 19]
Ensuring library compatibility was a major hurdle, especially in the early days of Vue 3. [16]
The migration build doesn't cover private API usage. [17]
