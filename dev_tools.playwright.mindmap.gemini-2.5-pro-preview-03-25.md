# Playwright #Automation #Testing #WebDev
Playwright is a framework for Web Testing and Automation. It allows testing Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API.

## Introduction to Playwright #Overview #Basics #GettingStarted
What Playwright is, its goals, and key advantages.
### What is Playwright? #Definition #Framework
End-to-end testing framework developed by Microsoft.
### Key Features #Capabilities #Advantages
Cross-browser, cross-platform, cross-language, auto-waits, network interception, mobile emulation, etc.
### Architecture #Design #Internals
How Playwright interacts with browsers (WebSocket connection, browser patching).
### Use Cases #Applications #Scenarios
E2E testing, web scraping, performance monitoring, accessibility testing, visual regression testing.

## Installation and Setup #Installation #Configuration #Environment
Setting up Playwright in different environments and languages.
### Prerequisites #Requirements #Dependencies
Node.js (for JS/TS), Python, .NET runtime, Java JDK.
### Installing Playwright #Setup #PackageManager
Using npm, yarn, pip, NuGet, Maven/Gradle.
### Installing Browsers #BrowserManagement #Setup
Command to install required browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).
### Project Initialization #Scaffolding #Boilerplate
Setting up a new test project (e.g., `npm init playwright`).
### Configuration File (`playwright.config.js`/`ts`) #Config #Settings
Test runner configuration options (browser types, viewport, base URL, timeouts, reporters).

## Core Concepts #Fundamentals #CoreAPI #BuildingBlocks
Fundamental ideas and objects within the Playwright API.
### Browser #CoreAPI #Instance
Represents a browser instance (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).
### Browser Context #Isolation #Sessions #CoreAPI
An isolated browser session, similar to an incognito window. Supports context-specific cookies, storage, permissions, network settings.
### Page #Tab #CoreAPI #InteractionSurface
Represents a single browser tab or popup. Primary interface for interacting with the web page.
### Frame #Iframe #CoreAPI
Represents an HTML frame (`<iframe>` or `<frame>`).
### Locator #Elements #Selection #CoreAPI
Represents a way to find element(s) on the page. Locators are strict and auto-waiting.
### ElementHandle #Elements #LegacyAPI
Represents an in-page DOM element. Generally superseded by Locators.
### JSHandle #JavaScript #CoreAPI
Represents an in-page JavaScript object.

## Browser Automation Basics #Actions #Interactions #Navigation
Fundamental actions performed on web pages.
### Launching Browsers #Setup #Initialization
Creating browser instances (`playwright.chromium.launch()`, etc.). Headless vs. headed mode.
### Creating Contexts and Pages #Setup #SessionManagement
`browser.newContext()`, `browser.newPage()`.
### Navigation #PageLoad #URL
`page.goto()`, `page.goBack()`, `page.goForward()`, `page.reload()`.
### Basic Interactions #UserActions #Input
`click()`, `fill()`, `type()`, `press()`, `check()`, `uncheck()`, `selectOption()`, `hover()`, `focus()`, `dragAndDrop()`.
### Page Information #State #Content
Getting URL, title, content (`page.url()`, `page.title()`, `page.content()`).

## Locators and Selectors #ElementSelection #FindingElements #DOM
Strategies for identifying elements on a web page.
### Introduction to Locators #ModernAPI #BestPractice
The preferred way to interact with elements. Auto-waiting and strict by default.
### Creating Locators #LocatorAPI #Syntax
`page.locator()`, `frame.locator()`, `locator.locator()`.
### Selecting by Role (ARIA) #Accessibility #Selectors #BestPractice
`page.getByRole()`. Preferred method for user-facing elements.

Using XPath expressions (`page.locator('xpath=...')`).
### Filtering Locators #LocatorAPI #Chaining
`locator.filter()`, `locator.first()`, `locator.last()`, `locator.nth()`.
### Locator Chaining #LocatorAPI #Hierarchy
Finding elements relative to other elements (`locator.locator(...)`).
### Locating UI Elements #LocatorAPI #UserFacing

## Waiting Mechanisms and Assertions #Synchronization #Validation #Testing
Ensuring actions happen at the right time and verifying application state.
### Auto-Waiting #ImplicitWait #CoreFeature
Playwright's built-in mechanism to wait for elements to be ready before acting.
### Explicit Waits #Conditions #Synchronization
Waiting for specific conditions or events.
#### Waiting for Navigation #PageLoad #Network
`page.waitForURL()`, `page.waitForLoadState()`.
#### Waiting for Elements #DOM #Visibility

#### Waiting for Network Responses #Network #Requests
`page.waitForResponse()`, `page.waitForRequest()`.
#### Waiting for Events #Events #CustomWait
`page.waitForEvent()`.
#### Waiting for Timeouts #Sleep #Debugging
`page.waitForTimeout()` (use sparingly).
### Assertions (`@playwright/test`) #Expect #Validation #Testing
Using the built-in `expect` library for test assertions.
#### Locator Assertions #ElementState #Validation
`expect(locator).toBeVisible()`, `expect(locator).toHaveText()`, `expect(locator).toBeEnabled()`, etc.
#### Page Assertions #PageState #Validation
`expect(page).toHaveURL()`, `expect(page).toHaveTitle()`.
#### API Response Assertions #Network #Validation
`expect(apiResponse).toBeOK()`.
#### Generic Assertions #Values #Validation
`expect(value).toEqual()`, `expect(value).toBe()`, `expect(value).toBeTruthy()`.
#### Custom Assertions #Extensibility #Validation
Creating reusable assertion functions.
#### Soft Assertions #NonBlocking #Validation
`expect.soft()`. Allows test execution to continue after a failed assertion.
