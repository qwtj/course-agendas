# Timeline of Greek Intellectual Periods #GreekHistory #Philosophy #IntellectualHistory
An overview of the major epochs shaping Greek thought, science, and culture.

## Precursors: Minoan & Mycenaean Civilizations (c. 2700–1100 BCE) #BronzeAge #AegeanCivilizations #Origins
Early Aegean civilizations laying groundwork, though direct intellectual continuity is debated.
### Minoan Civilization (c. 2700–1450 BCE) #Crete #PalatialCulture #LinearA
Centered on Crete, known for palace complexes, trade networks, and the undeciphered Linear A script. Intellectual life likely focused on administration, religion, and trade record-keeping.
### Mycenaean Civilization (c. 1600–1100 BCE) #MainlandGreece #WarriorCulture #LinearB
Dominant on mainland Greece, adopted and adapted Minoan culture. Known for fortified citadels (Mycenae, Tiryns), warrior aristocracy, and the Linear B script (an early form of Greek). Intellectual activity revolved around administration, inventories, and possibly epic oral traditions foreshadowing Homer.

## Greek Dark Ages (c. 1100–800 BCE) #IronAge #MigrationPeriod #OralTradition
Period following the collapse of Mycenaean civilization, characterized by depopulation, loss of literacy (Linear B disappears), and reduced material culture.
### Decline and Transition #Collapse #Illiteracy #Decentralization
Loss of centralized palace economies; shift to smaller, isolated settlements; disappearance of monumental building and sophisticated arts.
### Oral Tradition #EpicPoetry #Mythology #Homer
Preservation and development of myths, legends, and heroic tales through oral performance, laying the foundation for later literature (e.g., Homeric epics).
### Re-emergence of Writing (c. 9th-8th Century BCE) #Alphabet #PhoenicianInfluence #Literacy
Adoption and adaptation of the Phoenician alphabet, leading to the development of the Greek alphabet, enabling the later recording of literature and philosophy.

## Archaic Period (c. 800–480 BCE) #Polis #Colonization #EarlyPhilosophy
Marked by the rise of the city-state (polis), colonization, re-emergence of writing, and the birth of philosophy and science.
### Rise of the Polis #CityState #Citizenship #PoliticalThought
Development of independent city-states (e.g., Athens, Sparta, Corinth) as centers of political, social, and intellectual life. Emergence of concepts like citizenship and early political experimentation (oligarchy, tyranny, early democracy).
### Colonization and Trade #Mediterranean #BlackSea #CulturalExchange
Expansion across the Mediterranean and Black Seas, establishing colonies, fostering trade, and increasing cultural interaction (especially with the Near East and Egypt).
### Emergence of Literature #Homer #Hesiod #LyricPoetry
Recording of Homeric epics (Iliad, Odyssey) around the 8th century BCE. Hesiod's Theogony and Works and Days systematized mythology and explored ethics. Rise of lyric poetry (e.g., Sappho, Archilochus) expressing personal emotion.
### Pre-Socratic Philosophy (Ionian Enlightenment) #NaturalPhilosophy #Cosmology #Rationalism
Beginnings of philosophy in Ionia (Western coast of Anatolia), focusing on rational explanations of the natural world (cosmos) rather than mythological accounts. Emphasis on finding the fundamental substance (arche) and underlying principles.
#### Milesian School #Thales #Anaximander #Anaximenes
*   Thales (c. 624-545 BCE): Often considered the first philosopher; proposed water as the arche.
*   Anaximander (c. 610-546 BCE): Proposed the 'apeiron' (the indefinite/boundless) as the arche; early evolutionary ideas; produced one of the first world maps.
*   Anaximenes (c. 585-525 BCE): Proposed air as the arche, explaining change through condensation and rarefaction.
#### Other Early Thinkers #Pythagoras #Heraclitus #Xenophanes
*   Pythagoras (c. 570-495 BCE): Emphasized mathematics and numerical harmony as the basis of reality; believed in reincarnation; founded a quasi-religious community.

### Developments in Art and Architecture #OrientalizingStyle #Kouros #Kore

## Hellenistic Period (323–31 BCE) #AlexanderTheGreat #Cosmopolitanism #NewSchools
Begins with the death of Alexander the Great, whose conquests spread Greek culture (Hellenization) across the Near East, Egypt, and parts of Asia. Characterized by larger kingdoms (Ptolemaic, Seleucid, etc.), cosmopolitan cities (Alexandria, Antioch), new schools of philosophy, and scientific advancements.
### Spread of Hellenism #KoineGreek #Syncretism #LibraryOfAlexandria
Greek language (Koine) becomes lingua franca. Blending of Greek culture with local traditions (syncretism). Establishment of major centers of learning, especially the Library and Mouseion (Museum) at Alexandria under the Ptolemies.

#### Epicureanism #Epicurus #Ataraxia #Atomism
Founded by Epicurus (341–270 BCE). Aimed for happiness through modest pleasures, tranquility (ataraxia - freedom from disturbance), friendship, and freedom from fear (especially of death and gods). Based on atomistic physics derived from Democritus.

*   Archimedes (c. 287–212 BCE): Major contributions to mathematics (pi, calculus precursors), physics (hydrostatics, levers), and engineering (Archimedes screw, war machines).
*   Eratosthenes (c. 276–194 BCE): Calculated the circumference of the Earth with remarkable accuracy; geographer and librarian at Alexandria.
*   Astronomy: Aristarchus of Samos proposed a heliocentric model; Hipparchus (c. 190–120 BCE) developed trigonometry, created star catalogues, and worked on predictive astronomy.

Sculpture showed increased realism, emotion, and dynamism (e.g., Dying Gaul, Winged Victory of Samothrace, Venus de Milo). Rise of New Comedy (e.g., Menander) focusing on domestic life. Alexandrian poetry flourished (e.g., Callimachus, Theocritus).

## Roman Period (Greco-Roman) (c. 146 BCE onwards) #RomanEmpire #Syncretism #Transmission
Greece becomes part of the Roman world after the Battle of Corinth (146 BCE), culminating with the end of the last Hellenistic kingdom (Ptolemaic Egypt, 30 BCE). Greek intellectual traditions continue and influence Roman culture profoundly, spreading throughout the empire.
### Roman Absorption and Adaptation #Cicero #Lucretius #Seneca
Romans studied Greek philosophy, rhetoric, and literature, adapting them to their own context.
*   Cicero (106–43 BCE): Statesman, orator, and philosopher who translated Greek philosophical ideas (especially Stoicism, Academic Skepticism, Epicureanism) into Latin, making them accessible to a wider Roman audience.
