# I. Fundamentals of Music Theory

## Understanding Basic Notation

### Staff, Clef, and Ledger Lines
*   Identifying the lines and spaces on the staff.
*   Understanding the function of different clefs (treble, bass, alto, tenor).
*   Using ledger lines to extend the staff.

### Note Values and Rests
*   Understanding whole, half, quarter, eighth, and sixteenth notes.
*   Understanding corresponding rest values.
*   Calculating rhythmic durations.

### Time Signatures
*   Identifying the top and bottom numbers in a time signature.
*   Understanding simple time signatures (e.g., 4/4, 3/4, 2/4).
*   Understanding compound time signatures (e.g., 6/8, 9/8, 12/8).

## Understanding Pitch and Scales

### The Chromatic Scale
*   Understanding the 12 pitches in Western music.
*   Understanding sharps (#) and flats (b).

### Major Scales
*   Constructing major scales using the formula: W-W-H-W-W-W-H (where W = whole step, H = half step).
*   Identifying the characteristic sound of a major scale.
*   Examples: C Major, G Major, D Major.

### Minor Scales
*   Understanding natural, harmonic, and melodic minor scales.
*   Constructing minor scales relative to their parallel major.
*   Identifying the characteristic sound of each type of minor scale.
*   Examples: A Minor, E Minor, D Minor.

### Intervals
*   Identifying intervals by number (2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, octave).
*   Identifying intervals by quality (major, minor, perfect, augmented, diminished).
*   Examples: major 3rd, perfect 5th, minor 7th.

# II. Harmony and Chord Progressions

## Understanding Chords

### Triads
*   Constructing major, minor, diminished, and augmented triads.
*   Identifying the root, third, and fifth of a triad.
*   Examples: C Major (C-E-G), A Minor (A-C-E), B Diminished (B-D-F).

### Seventh Chords
*   Constructing major seventh, minor seventh, dominant seventh, and half-diminished seventh chords.
*   Identifying the root, third, fifth, and seventh of a seventh chord.
*   Examples: Cmaj7 (C-E-G-B), Am7 (A-C-E-G), G7 (G-B-D-F).

### Chord Inversions
*   Understanding root position, first inversion, and second inversion for triads.
*   Understanding root position, first, second and third inversion for seventh chords.
*   Identifying the bass note of each inversion.

## Understanding Basic Chord Progressions

### Diatonic Chords
*   Identifying diatonic chords in a major key (I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii°).
*   Identifying diatonic chords in a minor key (i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, VII).

### Common Chord Progressions
*   Understanding and analyzing common chord progressions (e.g., I-IV-V-I, ii-V-I, I-vi-IV-V).
*   Applying these progressions in different keys.

### Voice Leading
*   Understanding basic voice leading principles.
*   Avoiding parallel fifths and octaves.
*   Ensuring smooth transitions between chords.

# III. Advanced Theory Concepts

## Understanding Modulation

### Types of Modulation
*   Direct modulation.
*   Pivot chord modulation.
*   Sequential modulation.

### Common Key Relationships
*   Understanding closely related keys.
*   Modulating to the dominant, subdominant, relative major/minor.

## Understanding Form and Analysis

### Basic Musical Forms
*   Binary form (AB).
*   Ternary form (ABA).
*   Rondo form (ABACA).

### Sonata Form
*   Understanding exposition, development, and recapitulation.
*   Analyzing sonata form movements.

## Understanding Counterpoint

### Species Counterpoint
*   First species (note against note).
*   Second species (two notes against one).
*   Third species (four notes against one).
*   Fourth species (syncopation).
*   Fifth species (florid counterpoint).

### Writing Two-Part Inventions
*   Developing a subject and countersubject.
*   Using imitation and sequence.

# IV. Practical Applications

## Composition Exercises

### Writing a Melody
*   Creating a melody over a given chord progression.
*   Developing a melody using motives and variations.

### Harmonizing a Melody
*   Adding chords to a given melody.
*   Creating interesting and appropriate harmonies.

## Ear Training

### Interval Recognition
*   Identifying intervals by ear.
*   Using solfege or mnemonics.

### Chord Recognition
*   Identifying triads and seventh chords by ear.
*   Distinguishing between major and minor keys.

### Dictation
*   Transcribing melodies and rhythms.
*   Transcribing chord progressions.
