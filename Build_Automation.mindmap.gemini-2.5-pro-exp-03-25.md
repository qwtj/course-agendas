# Build Automation #Main #DevOps #CI/CD #SDLC
Build automation is the practice of scripting and automating the wide range of tasks involved in software build processes, such as retrieving source code, compiling it, running tests, and packaging it for deployment, often within a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.

### Definition #Level2 #Explanation
Build automation involves using tools and scripts to automate the transformation of source code into executable software, encompassing compilation, testing, packaging, and sometimes deployment, minimizing manual intervention. [1, 5, 4, 21, 12, 22]

### Purpose #Level2 #Goals
The primary aim is to make the build process faster, more reliable, consistent, and repeatable, reducing manual errors and freeing up developer time. [1, 2, 5, 4]

Ensuring that the build process yields the same result every time it is run with the same inputs, regardless of the environment or user executing it. [1, 5, 4, 20]

### Idempotency #Level2 #Consistency
Build scripts should produce the same outcome whether run once or multiple times with the same initial conditions.

### Dependency Management #Level2 #Libraries #Components
