# Ages of History #Chronology #Periodization
A hierarchical overview of the major periods used by historians to divide the past. Periodization schemes can vary by region and focus, but this outlines a common Western-centric framework.

## Historiography and Periodization Issues #Concepts #Methods #Debate
Understanding how history is divided and the limitations of these divisions.
### Defining Historical Periods #Concepts #Frameworks
The practice of dividing history into quantifiable, named blocks of time or periods.
### Basis for Periodization #Criteria #Events #Developments
Periods are often defined by major technological shifts (Stone, Bronze, Iron), dominant political structures (Empires, Feudalism, Nation-States), cultural movements (Renaissance, Enlightenment), or transformative events (Revolutions, World Wars).
### Western vs. Non-Western Periodization #GlobalHistory #Bias #Perspectives
Acknowledging that the common periodization (Ancient, Medieval, Modern) is largely Eurocentric and may not align well with the histories of other regions like Asia, Africa, or the Americas. Different cultures have their own significant turning points and historical trajectories.
### Criticisms and Challenges #Debate #Historiography #Limitations
Periodization can oversimplify complex transitions, imply sharp breaks where none existed, and impose value judgments (e.g., "Dark Ages").
