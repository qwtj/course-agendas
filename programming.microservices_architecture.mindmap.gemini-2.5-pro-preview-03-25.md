# Microservices Architecture #Overview #ArchitectureStyle
An architectural style structuring an application as a collection of small, autonomous, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services. [1, 4, 5, 11, 12, 15, 31, 36]

## Core Concepts and Characteristics #Basics #Fundamentals
Understanding the foundational ideas behind microservices. [11, 12, 15, 31]

### Definition #Definition #CoreIdea
Structuring an application as a collection of small, independent services that communicate over a network, typically using lightweight protocols like HTTP/REST or gRPC. [4, 5, 11, 12, 15, 31]
Each service focuses on a specific business capability. [4, 12, 31, 32]

### Key Characteristics #Features #Attributes
Essential traits that define a microservice architecture. [11, 17]
    *   **Independently Deployable:** Services can be deployed without affecting others. [1, 5, 11, 12, 31]
    *   **Loosely Coupled:** Changes in one service have minimal impact on others. [1, 5, 11, 17, 21, 27]
    *   **Organized Around Business Capabilities:** Services map to specific business functions. [4, 12, 31, 32]
    *   **Decentralized Governance:** Teams can choose the best technology stack for their service. [11, 12, 32]
    *   **Decentralized Data Management:** Each service typically manages its own data. [11, 22, 24, 28, 32]
    *   **Design for Failure:** Building resilient systems that handle service failures gracefully. [32]
    *   **Scalability:** Individual services can be scaled independently. [11, 17, 45]
    *   **Flexibility:** Easier to adopt new technologies. [11]

### Comparison with Monolithic Architecture #Comparison #Alternatives
Understanding the differences, benefits, and drawbacks compared to traditional monoliths. [1, 5, 45]
    *   **Monolith:** Single, large codebase; tightly coupled components; single deployment unit.
    *   **Microservices:** Multiple smaller codebases; loosely coupled; independent deployments. [1, 5, 45]
    *   **Benefits of Microservices:** Scalability, flexibility, faster time-to-market, fault isolation, team autonomy. [11, 45]
    *   **Drawbacks of Microservices:** Increased complexity (distributed systems), operational overhead, network latency, data consistency challenges. [1, 4, 12, 42]

## Design Principles #Design #Guidelines
Guiding principles for architecting effective microservices. [21, 27, 34, 35, 41]

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) #SRP #Focus
Each microservice should have one, well-defined responsibility or business capability. [21, 22, 27, 32, 41]
Avoid creating services that do too many things.

### Loose Coupling #Coupling #Independence
Minimize dependencies between services. Services should interact via well-defined APIs. [1, 5, 11, 17, 21, 27]

### High Cohesion #Cohesion #Relatedness
Elements within a single microservice should be strongly related and focused on the service's single purpose. [21, 32]

### Bounded Context (Domain-Driven Design) #DDD #Boundaries
Designing services around specific business domain boundaries. [12, 27, 32, 34]
Helps define clear service responsibilities and APIs.

### Database per Service #Data #Isolation
Each microservice should own and manage its own database schema and data. [1, 22, 24, 28, 32, 40]
Prevents tight coupling at the data layer.

### Design for Failure #Resilience #FaultTolerance
Anticipate and handle failures gracefully (e.g., network issues, service unavailability). [32]
Implement patterns like Circuit Breakers, Retries. [1, 32]

### Autonomy #Independence #SelfContained
Services should be autonomous, capable of being developed, deployed, and scaled independently. [11, 17, 21, 31, 35]

## Communication Patterns #Communication #Interaction
How services interact with each other. [7, 9, 16, 17, 18, 23, 29, 32]

### Synchronous Communication #Sync #RequestResponse
The caller waits for a response from the called service. [9, 16, 23, 29, 32]
    *   **REST (HTTP/HTTPS):** Common, simple, text-based (JSON/XML). [4, 9, 16]
    *   **gRPC:** Efficient, binary protocol, uses Protocol Buffers, supports streaming. [9, 17, 23, 32]
    *   **Pros:** Simplicity, immediate feedback.
    *   **Cons:** Tight runtime coupling, potential for cascading failures, latency issues. [13, 23]

### Asynchronous Communication #Async #Messaging #EventDriven
The caller does not wait for an immediate response; communication often via message queues or event streams. [7, 9, 16, 23, 29, 32]
    *   **Message Queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, SQS):** Point-to-point or publish/subscribe. [7, 29]
    *   **Event Streams (e.g., Kafka, Kinesis):** Publish/subscribe model for event-driven architectures. [7, 29, 32]
    *   **Styles:** Request/Response, Notifications, Request/Async Response, Publish/Subscribe. [7]
    *   **Pros:** Loose coupling, improved availability, fault isolation, scalability. [7, 23]
    *   **Cons:** Increased complexity (message brokers), eventual consistency challenges, debugging difficulties. [9]

### API Gateway #Gateway #Entrypoint
A single entry point for client requests, routing them to appropriate backend services. [1, 17, 18, 22, 31, 32, 39, 47]
    *   **Responsibilities:** Routing, aggregation, authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, protocol translation. [31, 32]
    *   **Benefits:** Simplifies client interaction, centralizes cross-cutting concerns, improves security. [31]
    *   **Patterns:** Backend for Frontend (BFF).

### Service Discovery #Discovery #Registry
Mechanism for services to find the network locations (IP address, port) of other services. [1, 17, 18, 32, 39, 47]
    *   **Patterns:** Client-Side Discovery, Server-Side Discovery. [1]
    *   **Tools:** Service Registry (e.g., Eureka, Consul, Zookeeper). [17, 47]

### Service Mesh #ServiceMesh #Infrastructure
Dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication (e.g., Istio, Linkerd). [4, 9, 23]
    *   **Features:** Traffic management, load balancing, service discovery, security (mTLS), observability. [23]
    *   **Pattern:** Sidecar proxy. [34]

## Data Management #Data #Persistence
Strategies for handling data in a distributed microservices environment. [1, 24, 28, 32, 40]

### Database per Service #Pattern #Isolation
Each microservice manages its own private database. [1, 22, 24, 28, 32, 40]
Promotes loose coupling and independent evolution. [24, 28]

### Shared Database #Pattern #Coupling
Multiple services share a single database (generally considered an anti-pattern in microservices). [24, 40]
Leads to tight coupling and coordination challenges. [24]

### Polyglot Persistence #DataStores #Flexibility
Using different database technologies for different microservices based on their specific needs (e.g., SQL for transactions, NoSQL for catalogs). [24, 40]

### Distributed Transactions #Consistency #Transactions
Managing transactions that span multiple services. [1, 32]
    *   **Two-Phase Commit (2PC):** Traditional approach, often avoided due to blocking and coupling issues.
    *   **Saga Pattern:** Managing distributed transactions via a sequence of local transactions, coordinated via events or choreography/orchestration. [1, 7, 32] Compensating transactions are used to roll back.

### Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) #CQRS #DataAccess
Separating read (Query) and write (Command) operations, often using different data models or even databases. [1, 7, 32, 34]
Optimizes read/write performance and scalability.

### Event Sourcing #Events #State
Storing the state of an entity as a sequence of immutable events rather than the current state. [34]
Often used with CQRS. Provides audit logs and ability to reconstruct past states. [34]

### Data Consistency Strategies #Consistency #Tradeoffs
Managing consistency across services. [24, 28, 40, 42]
    *   **Strong Consistency:** All services see the same data state immediately (difficult/costly in distributed systems). [28]
    *   **Eventual Consistency:** Data becomes consistent over time, often via asynchronous updates (common in microservices). [31, 40]

### CI/CD Pipelines #CICD #Automation
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery for automating build, test, and deployment processes for each service. [3, 11, 25, 27, 39]

### Deployment Patterns #ReleaseStrategies #Updates
    *   **Recreate:** Stop the old version, deploy the new one (causes downtime). [25]
    *   **Rolling Update:** Gradually replace instances of the old version with the new version. [25]
    *   **Blue-Green Deployment:** Deploy the new version alongside the old; switch traffic when ready. Allows easy rollback. [3, 8, 25, 36]
    *   **Canary Release:** Gradually roll out the new version to a small subset of users/traffic before full release. [3, 8]
    *   **A/B Testing:** Deploy different versions to different user segments to compare features/performance. [25]
    *   **Shadow Deployment / Dark Launching:** Deploy new version alongside old, routing production traffic to both but only using responses from the old version initially. [8, 25]
