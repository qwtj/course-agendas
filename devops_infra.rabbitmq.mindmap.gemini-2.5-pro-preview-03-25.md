# RabbitMQ #MessageBroker #AMQP
RabbitMQ is a widely-used open-source message broker software, also known as message-oriented middleware. It acts as an intermediary for transmitting messages between different applications, systems, or services, enabling asynchronous communication and decoupling. [2, 6, 27, 41]

## Core Concepts #Basics #Fundamentals
Understanding the fundamental building blocks of RabbitMQ. [5, 6, 30]
### Producer #Client #Sender
An application responsible for sending messages. [6]
### Consumer #Client #Receiver
An application responsible for receiving and processing messages. [6, 30]
### Message #Data #Payload
The unit of data sent from the producer to a consumer via RabbitMQ. Can contain any information (e.g., text, JSON, binary). [6, 5]
### Queue #Storage #Buffer
A buffer that stores messages until a consumer processes them. Queues ensure messages are held until needed. [6, 5, 30]
Key properties include durability, exclusivity, and auto-deletion. [5]
### Exchange #Routing #Dispatcher
Receives messages from producers and routes them to appropriate queues based on rules defined by the exchange type and bindings. [6, 5, 30]
### Binding #Link #Rule
A link or relationship between an exchange and a queue, defining how messages should be routed based on criteria like routing keys or headers. [6, 5, 30]
### Routing Key #Address #Label
An attribute (like an address) attached to a message that the exchange uses to determine how to route the message to bound queues. [6, 5]
### Connection #Network #TCP
A TCP connection established between an application (producer or consumer) and the RabbitMQ broker. [6]
### Channel #Multiplexing #VirtualConnection
A virtual connection within a TCP connection. Publishing and consuming happen over channels. Multiple channels can exist within a single connection, reducing TCP overhead. [6, 15]
Channels can operate in confirm or transactional mode. [15]
### Virtual Host (Vhost) #Isolation #Namespace
Provides a way to segregate applications using the same RabbitMQ instance. Queues, exchanges, and bindings belong to a specific vhost. [34]

## Architecture Overview #Design #Structure
High-level view of RabbitMQ components and their interactions. [22, 30]
### Broker #Server #Middleware
The RabbitMQ server software that manages exchanges, queues, bindings, and routes messages. [2]
### Nodes #ServerInstance #Process
A single instance of a RabbitMQ broker. Multiple nodes can form a cluster. [16, 19]
### Clusters #Scalability #HighAvailability
A logical grouping of multiple RabbitMQ nodes sharing users, vhosts, queues, exchanges, etc., to provide scalability and high availability. [16, 19, 32]
### Clients #Application #Integration
Applications (producers/consumers) that connect to the RabbitMQ broker to send or receive messages using client libraries. [6]
### AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) #Protocol #Standard
The primary protocol implemented by RabbitMQ for messaging, defining the rules for communication between clients and the broker. [6, 27, 33]
RabbitMQ also supports other protocols like MQTT, STOMP via plugins. [2, 18, 41]

## Installation and Configuration #Setup #Deployment

## Exchanges In-Depth #Routing #ExchangeTypes
Detailed exploration of different exchange types and their routing behaviors. [5, 33, 34]
### Direct Exchange #Unicast #ExactMatch
Routes messages to queues whose binding key exactly matches the message's routing key. [34, 33]
### Fanout Exchange #Broadcast #PubSub
Routes messages to all queues bound to it, ignoring the routing key. Ideal for broadcasting. [34, 33, 46]
### Topic Exchange #Multicast #PatternMatch
Routes messages to queues based on wildcard matches between the routing key and the routing pattern specified in the binding. [34, 33]
### Headers Exchange #Attributes #MetadataMatch
Routes messages based on matching header attributes rather than the routing key. [34, 33]
### Exchange Properties #Configuration #Options
#### Durability #Persistence #Reliability
Ensuring exchanges survive broker restarts.
#### Auto-delete #Lifecycle #Cleanup
Deleting the exchange when it has no more bindings.
#### Internal Exchanges #BrokerOnly #Utility
Exchanges used internally by the broker, not directly accessible by publishers.

## Queues In-Depth #Storage #QueueTypes
Detailed exploration of queue types and properties. [5, 4]
### Queue Properties #Configuration #Behavior
#### Durability #Persistence #Reliability
Ensures queues (and their messages if persistent) survive broker restarts. [5, 10]
#### Exclusivity #SingleConsumer #Temporary
Queues that can only be used by one connection and are deleted when that connection closes. [5]
#### Auto-delete #Lifecycle #Cleanup
Queues that are deleted when their last consumer unsubscribes. [5]
#### Message TTL (Time-To-Live) #Expiration #Limits [4]
Setting expiration times for messages in a queue.
#### Max Length/Bytes #Limits #BoundedQueues [4]
Limiting the number of messages or total size of messages in a queue.
#### Lazy Queues (Pre-v3.12) #Performance #Memory [4, 10]
Queues that moved messages to disk quickly to minimize RAM usage, now default behavior for classic queues (v3.12+). [10]
### Queue Types #Variants #Capabilities
#### Classic Queues #Standard #Default
The original queue type, supporting various modes and features.
#### Quorum Queues #Replication #Consistency [4, 18, 32]
Newer replicated queue type providing high availability and data safety using the Raft consensus algorithm. Recommended for HA. [32, 18]
#### Mirrored Queues (Legacy HA) #Replication #Availability [3, 14, 32]
Older HA queue type, replicating queue contents across multiple cluster nodes. Largely superseded by Quorum Queues. [14, 32]

## Messages and Payloads #Data #Format
Understanding message structure and properties. [6, 34]
### Message Structure #Components #Format
#### Body/Payload #Content #Data
The actual content being transmitted. [34]
#### Properties/Headers #Metadata #Attributes [34]
Attributes controlling message handling (e.g., delivery mode, priority, expiration). [34]
Common headers include `delivery_mode`, `content_type`, `reply_to`, `correlation_id`.
### Message Persistence #Durability #Storage [2, 22, 18]
Ensuring messages survive broker restarts by persisting them to disk (requires durable queues and persistent delivery mode). [22, 18]
### Message Acknowledgements (Acks) #Reliability #Confirmation [2, 5, 33]
Consumers confirming message processing to RabbitMQ, allowing safe removal from the queue. [5]
#### Automatic vs Manual Acks #Modes #Control [44]
#### Negative Acknowledgements (Nacks) #Failure #Rejection [34]
Consumers signaling failed processing, potentially requeueing or dead-lettering the message. [34]
#### Multiple Acks #Performance #Batching [21]
Acknowledging multiple messages with a single confirmation.

## Publishing Messages #Sending #ProducerLogic
Mechanisms and considerations for sending messages. [5]
### Basic Publish #Send #CoreAPI

## Consuming Messages #Receiving #ConsumerLogic
Mechanisms and considerations for receiving messages. [5]
### Basic Consume (Push API) #Subscription #Asynchronous
Subscribing to a queue; the broker pushes messages to the consumer asynchronously. [2]
### Basic Get (Pull API) #Polling #Synchronous
Requesting a single message from a queue synchronously. Less common/efficient than Basic Consume.
### Consumer Prefetch (QoS) #FlowControl #RateLimiting [4, 21]
Limiting the number of unacknowledged messages a consumer can receive at once, preventing overload. [21]
### Consumer Cancellation #Stopping #Lifecycle
Stopping a consumer from receiving further messages. [22]

### Priority Queues #Ordering #Urgency [2, 22]
Allowing messages with higher priority to be consumed before lower-priority messages. [22]
### Alternate Exchanges (AE) #Fallback #Routing
An exchange configured on another exchange to receive messages that cannot be routed by the primary exchange.
