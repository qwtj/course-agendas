# I. Introduction to AWS SAM and Serverless Computing

## Understanding Serverless Concepts
"Explain the core principles of serverless computing, focusing on concepts like event-driven architecture, pay-per-execution pricing, and managed infrastructure. Contrast this with traditional server-based application deployment models, highlighting the benefits and trade-offs of using serverless on AWS."

## Introduction to AWS SAM
"Describe AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) as an open-source framework for building serverless applications on AWS. Explain its relationship to AWS CloudFormation and how it simplifies defining serverless resources like Functions, APIs, and Databases."

### SAM vs. CloudFormation
"Compare and contrast AWS SAM syntax with native AWS CloudFormation syntax for defining common serverless resources (e.g., Lambda functions, API Gateway endpoints). Provide examples illustrating how SAM provides shorthand syntax for these resources."

### Key SAM Components Overview
"Provide a high-level overview of the main components of the AWS SAM ecosystem, including the SAM Template specification, the SAM Command Line Interface (CLI), and their roles in the development, testing, and deployment lifecycle."
*   **SAM Template:** "Explain the structure and purpose of the `template.yaml` file in SAM."
*   **SAM CLI:** "Briefly introduce the core commands of the SAM CLI (`sam init`, `sam build`, `sam deploy`, `sam local`) and their functions."

> **Summary:** "Provide a concise summary of what AWS SAM is, its benefits for serverless development, and its core components (template, CLI)."
> **Glossary:** "Define key terms introduced in Section I: Serverless, Event-Driven Architecture, AWS SAM, AWS CloudFormation, SAM Template, SAM CLI."
> **Quiz:** "Create a short multiple-choice quiz testing understanding of basic serverless concepts and the purpose of AWS SAM."
> **Reflective Prompt:** "Ask the learner to reflect on a potential use case where serverless computing and AWS SAM could simplify application development compared to traditional methods."

# II. Setting Up Your Development Environment and First SAM Application

## Installing the AWS SAM CLI
"Provide step-by-step instructions for installing the AWS SAM CLI on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux). Include prerequisites like installing AWS CLI, Docker (for `sam local`), and configuring AWS credentials."

### Verifying Installation
"Show the command (`sam --version`) to verify a successful SAM CLI installation and explain the expected output."

## Creating Your First SAM Application (`sam init`)
"Explain how to use the `sam init` command to create a new serverless application from a template. Describe the common template options (e.g., Hello World examples for different runtimes like Python, Node.js) and the resulting project structure."

### Exploring the Project Structure
"Describe the standard directory structure created by `sam init`, explaining the purpose of key files like `template.yaml`, `hello_world/app.py` (or equivalent), `events/event.json`, and `requirements.txt` (or `package.json`)."
*   `template.yaml`: "Provide a prompt to analyze the default `template.yaml` generated by `sam init`, identifying the resources defined (e.g., Lambda function, API Gateway)."
*   `app.py` / `index.js`: "Provide a prompt to examine the sample Lambda function code, explaining its basic handler structure."
*   `event.json`: "Provide a prompt to explain the purpose of the sample event file (`event.json`) for local testing."

> **Key Point:** "Highlight that `sam init` provides a standardized starting point, accelerating the setup process for new serverless projects."
> **Further Exploration:** "[Link to official AWS SAM CLI installation guide]"
> **Cross-Reference:** (Refer back to Section I's definition of SAM Template and SAM CLI).

## Local Testing with `sam local invoke`
"Explain how to use the `sam local invoke` command to test a Lambda function locally using a sample event payload. Demonstrate the command syntax, referencing the function's logical ID from `template.yaml` and the event file."
*   **Command Example:**
    ```bash
    # <prompt: Generate the sam local invoke command for a function named HelloWorldFunction using events/event.json>
    sam local invoke HelloWorldFunction -e events/event.json
    ```

## Local API Testing with `sam local start-api`
"Explain how to use the `sam local start-api` command to emulate an API Gateway endpoint locally, allowing testing of API-triggered Lambda functions via HTTP requests."
*   **Command Example:**
    ```bash
    # <prompt: Generate the sam local start-api command>
    sam local start-api
    ```
*   **Testing:** "Provide a prompt showing how to use `curl` or a browser to send a request to the local API endpoint (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:3000/hello`)."

# III. Understanding the SAM Template (`template.yaml`)

## Core Template Sections
"Describe the main sections of a SAM `template.yaml` file, including `AWSTemplateFormatVersion`, `Transform`, `Globals`, `Resources`, `Parameters`, and `Outputs`."

### `Transform` Section
"Explain the purpose of the `Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31` declaration and why it's essential for SAM templates."

### `Globals` Section
"Explain how the `Globals` section can be used to define common properties for resources of the same type (e.g., `Function`, `Api`), reducing redundancy in the `Resources` section. Provide an example setting a default `Runtime` and `Timeout` for all functions."
*   **Example:**
    ```yaml
    # <prompt: Generate a Globals section setting Python 3.9 runtime and 10 second timeout for all AWS::Serverless::Function resources>
    Globals:
      Function:
        Runtime: python3.9
        Timeout: 10
        Handler: app.lambda_handler
    ```

### `Resources` Section
"Explain that the `Resources` section is where specific AWS resources (both CloudFormation and SAM-specific types) are defined. This is the core of the template."

### `Parameters` Section
"Describe how to use the `Parameters` section to define input parameters for the SAM template, allowing customization during deployment (e.g., environment names, table names). Show an example defining a `StageName` parameter."

### `Outputs` Section
"Explain how the `Outputs` section is used to declare values that should be easily accessible after deployment, such as API endpoint URLs or function ARNs. Provide an example outputting an API Gateway URL."

## Defining Serverless Resources
"Introduce the primary SAM resource types used for building serverless applications."

### `AWS::Serverless::Function`
"Explain how to define a Lambda function using `AWS::Serverless::Function`. Cover essential properties like `Handler`, `Runtime`, `CodeUri`, `MemorySize`, `Timeout`, `Policies`, and `Events`."

    # <prompt: Generate a simple AWS::Serverless::Function resource definition named 'MyLambdaFunction' with Python 3.9 runtime, pointing to code in 'src/my_function/', with handler 'app.handler'>
    Resources:
      MyLambdaFunction:
        Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
        Properties:
          FunctionName: my-lambda-function-${StageName} # Example using a Parameter
          CodeUri: src/my_function/
          Handler: app.handler
          Runtime: python3.9
          MemorySize: 256
          Timeout: 15
    ```

              Method: get
    ```

### `AWS::Serverless::Api`
"Explain how to define an API Gateway REST API using `AWS::Serverless::Api`. Cover properties like `StageName`, `DefinitionBody` (for OpenAPI/Swagger), and implicit API creation when using `Api` events in functions."
*   **Implicit API Example:** "Explain that defining an `Api` event source within an `AWS::Serverless::Function` automatically creates an `AWS::Serverless::Api` resource if one isn't explicitly defined."
*   **Explicit API Example:**
    ```yaml
    # <prompt: Generate an explicit AWS::Serverless::Api resource definition named 'MyApi' with stage name 'Prod' and CORS configuration.>
    Resources:
      MyApi:
        Type: AWS::Serverless::Api
        Properties:
          StageName: Prod
          Cors:
            AllowMethods: "'GET,POST,OPTIONS'"
            AllowHeaders: "'Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token'"
            AllowOrigin: "'*'" # Be cautious with '*' in production
    ```

### `AWS::Serverless::HttpApi`
"Explain the `AWS::Serverless::HttpApi` resource type for defining lighter-weight, lower-cost API Gateway HTTP APIs. Contrast it with `AWS::Serverless::Api` (REST APIs)."

    # <prompt: Generate a simple AWS::Serverless::HttpApi resource definition named 'MyHttpApi'>
    Resources:
      MyHttpApi:
        Type: AWS::Serverless::HttpApi
        Properties:
          StageName: Prod
    ```

### `AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable`
"Explain how to define a DynamoDB table with sensible defaults using `AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable`. Cover properties like `PrimaryKey` and `TableName`."
*   **Example:**
    ```yaml
    # <prompt: Generate an AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable resource definition named 'MyDataTable' with a primary key 'userId' of type String.>
    Resources:
      MyDataTable:
        Type: AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable
        Properties:
          TableName: my-data-table-${StageName}
          PrimaryKey:
            Name: userId
            Type: String
          ProvisionedThroughput:
            ReadCapacityUnits: 1
            WriteCapacityUnits: 1
    ```

## Intrinsic Functions
"Introduce AWS CloudFormation intrinsic functions (e.g., `!Ref`, `!GetAtt`, `!Sub`) and explain how they are used within SAM templates to reference resources, parameters, outputs, and construct dynamic values."
*   `!Ref`: "Explain how `!Ref` is used to reference parameters or the default identifier of a resource (e.g., Lambda function name, Table name)."
*   `!GetAtt`: "Explain how `!GetAtt` is used to get attributes of a resource (e.g., the ARN of a Lambda function `!GetAtt MyLambdaFunction.Arn`)."
*   `!Sub`: "Explain how `!Sub` is used for string substitution, embedding variables like `${StageName}` or resource attributes like `${MyLambdaFunction.Arn}`."

> **Summary:** "Recap the key sections of a SAM template (`Globals`, `Resources`, `Parameters`, `Outputs`), the main SAM resource types (`Function`, `Api`, `HttpApi`, `SimpleTable`), and the use of intrinsic functions for dynamic configuration."
> **Glossary:** "Define: `Globals`, `Resources`, `Parameters`, `Outputs`, `AWS::Serverless::Function`, `AWS::Serverless::Api`, `AWS::Serverless::HttpApi`, `AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable`, Intrinsic Functions (`!Ref`, `!GetAtt`, `!Sub`), `CodeUri`, `Handler`, `Runtime`, `Events`."
> **Quiz:** "Create a quiz testing knowledge of template sections, resource types, key properties, and the purpose of intrinsic functions."
> **Reflective Prompt:** "Ask the learner to think about how the `Globals` section could simplify managing configurations across multiple functions in a larger application."
> **Cross-Reference:** (Refer to Section V for more advanced template patterns and resource types).

### Using Containers for Builds (`--use-container`)
"Explain the `--use-container` flag for `sam build`. Describe why it's important for building dependencies that include native C extensions or when the build environment needs to match the Lambda execution environment precisely (e.g., Amazon Linux)."
*   **Command Example:**
    ```bash
    # <prompt: Generate the sam build command using the --use-container flag>
    sam build --use-container
    ```

### Building Specific Resources

### Guided Deployments (`--guided`)
"Describe the `--guided` option for `sam deploy`. Explain how it interactively prompts for deployment parameters (Stack Name, AWS Region, Parameter Overrides, Capabilities) and saves them to a `samconfig.toml` file for future deployments."
*   **Command Example:**
    ```bash
    # <prompt: Generate the sam deploy command using the --guided flag>
    sam deploy --guided
    ```
*   **Key Prompts:** "List and explain the common prompts during a guided deployment: Stack Name, AWS Region, Confirm changes before deploy, Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation, Capabilities (e.g., `CAPABILITY_IAM`)."

### Using `samconfig.toml`
"Explain the purpose and structure of the `samconfig.toml` file generated by `--guided` deployments. Show how subsequent `sam deploy` commands (without `--guided`) use this file for configuration, enabling repeatable deployments."

### Required Capabilities
"Explain why deployments often require specific capabilities like `CAPABILITY_IAM` or `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` when the template creates IAM roles or policies, and how to provide them via `--capabilities` or the guided deployment."

## Viewing Stack Outputs and Resources (`sam list`)
"Introduce the `sam list endpoints`, `sam list resources`, and `sam list stack-outputs` commands to easily retrieve information about deployed resources like API endpoints, function ARNs, and CloudFormation stack outputs."

> **Key Point:** "Emphasize the workflow: `Develop -> sam build -> sam deploy`. Highlight the role of `sam build` in preparing artifacts and `sam deploy` in managing the CloudFormation stack."
> **Further Exploration:** "[Link to AWS documentation on `sam build` and `sam deploy`]"

## Deleting the Application Stack (`sam delete`)
"Explain how to use the `sam delete` command to remove the deployed CloudFormation stack and associated resources. Mention the use of `samconfig.toml` or specifying the `--stack-name`."

> **Summary:** "Summarize the build (`sam build`) and deployment (`sam deploy`) process, including the use of containers, guided deployments, `samconfig.toml`, capabilities, and how to view and delete deployed stacks."
> **Quiz:** "Create a quiz covering the purpose of `sam build`, `--use-container`, `sam deploy`, `--guided`, `samconfig.toml`, capabilities, and `sam delete`."
> **Reflective Prompt:** "Ask the learner to consider the benefits of using `samconfig.toml` for managing deployments across different environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod)."

    # <prompt: Generate a sample buildspec.yml for an AWS SAM application using Python 3.9. It should install dependencies, run 'sam build --use-container', potentially run tests (placeholder), and package the template.>
    version: 0.2

    phases:
      install:
        runtime-versions:
          python: 3.9
        commands:
          - echo "Installing dependencies..."
          - pip install aws-sam-cli
          - pip install -r requirements.txt -t ./ # Install function dependencies if needed for tests
      build:
        commands:

          - sam build --use-container
          # - echo "Running unit tests..." # Placeholder for test command
          # - python -m pytest tests/
      post_build:
        commands:
          - echo "Packaging SAM template..."
          - aws cloudformation package --template-file .aws-sam/build/template.yaml --s3-bucket $ARTIFACT_BUCKET --output-template-file packaged-template.yaml

# VII. Monitoring, Debugging, and Optimization

## Monitoring with CloudWatch
"Explain how SAM applications integrate with Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring."

### CloudWatch Logs
"Describe how Lambda function logs are automatically sent to CloudWatch Logs. Show how to find log groups associated with deployed functions (usually `/aws/lambda/<function-name>`). Explain how to use `sam logs` command to fetch logs for a specific function."
*   **`sam logs` Command:**
    ```bash
    # <prompt: Generate the sam logs command to fetch logs for a function named 'MyLambdaFunction' deployed in stack 'my-sam-stack', tailing the logs.>
    sam logs -n MyLambdaFunction --stack-name my-sam-stack --tail
    ```

### CloudWatch Metrics
"Explain that Lambda, API Gateway, and other services publish metrics (e.g., Invocations, Errors, Duration, Throttles) to CloudWatch. Show where to find these metrics in the AWS console and how to create basic CloudWatch Alarms based on them (e.g., high error rate)."

### CloudWatch Application Insights
"Briefly introduce CloudWatch Application Insights as a service that helps monitor .NET and SQL Server applications, but mention its potential integration points or similar monitoring approaches for serverless apps if applicable or relevant." (Adjust based on SAM's direct integration level - focus might be better on X-Ray).

## Distributed Tracing with AWS X-Ray
"Explain the importance of distributed tracing for understanding request flows in complex serverless applications. Describe how to enable AWS X-Ray tracing for API Gateway and Lambda functions within the SAM template."
*   **Enabling Tracing (Lambda):**
    ```yaml
    # <prompt: Show the property to enable AWS X-Ray tracing on an AWS::Serverless::Function.>
        Properties:
          # ... other function properties
          Tracing: Active
    ```
*   **Enabling Tracing (API Gateway):**
    ```yaml
    # <prompt: Show the property to enable AWS X-Ray tracing on an AWS::Serverless::Api or AWS::Serverless::HttpApi.>
        Properties:
          # ... other API properties
          TracingEnabled: true
    ```
*   **Using the X-Ray SDK:** "Mention the need to include and use the AWS X-Ray SDK within the Lambda function code (e.g., for Python using `aws-xray-sdk`) to trace calls to downstream AWS services or external HTTP endpoints."

## Debugging Techniques
"Outline strategies for debugging SAM applications."

### Local Debugging (`sam local start-lambda`, `sam local start-api --debug`)
"Revisit `sam local` commands, highlighting their debugging capabilities. Explain how to use `sam local start-lambda` or `sam local start-api` with the `--debug-port` (or `-d`) option to attach a debugger from an IDE (like VS Code)."
*   **Command Example:**
    ```bash
    # <prompt: Generate the sam local start-api command enabling debugging on port 5858.>
    sam local start-api -d 5858
    ```
*   **IDE Configuration:** "Briefly describe the concept of configuring an IDE (e.g., VS Code `launch.json`) to attach to the specified debug port."

### Remote Debugging (CloudWatch Logs & X-Ray)
"Emphasize using CloudWatch Logs (including structured logging) and X-Ray traces as the primary methods for debugging issues in deployed environments."

### Step-Through Debugging (AWS Toolkit for VS Code/JetBrains)
"Mention IDE toolkits like the AWS Toolkit for VS Code or JetBrains, which offer integrated features for step-through debugging of Lambda functions directly in the cloud (often by temporarily modifying the function configuration)."

## Performance Optimization
"Discuss common areas for optimizing SAM applications."

### Lambda Function Optimization
*   **Memory Tuning:** "Explain the relationship between Lambda function `MemorySize` and CPU allocation. Describe how to test different memory settings to find the optimal balance between cost and performance. Mention tools like AWS Lambda Power Tuning."
*   **Cold Starts:** "Explain the concept of Lambda cold starts. Discuss mitigation strategies like Provisioned Concurrency, optimizing initialization code (outside the handler), reducing dependencies, and choosing appropriate runtimes."
*   **Dependency Management:** "Reiterate the importance of minimizing deployment package size and using Layers effectively."

### API Gateway Optimization
*   **Caching:** "Explain how to enable API Gateway caching to reduce latency and Lambda invocations for frequently accessed endpoints."
*   **Throttling and Usage Plans:** "Describe how to configure throttling limits and usage plans for API consumers."

### Database Optimization (DynamoDB)
*   **Provisioned vs. On-Demand:** "Discuss choosing between Provisioned Throughput and On-Demand capacity modes for DynamoDB tables (`AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable` or `AWS::DynamoDB::Table`)."
*   **Indexing:** "Mention the importance of appropriate DynamoDB indexing (Primary Keys, Secondary Indexes) for query performance."

## Improving Techniques and Benchmarking
*   **Load Testing:** "Stress the importance of load testing serverless applications (using tools like `artillery`, K6, or serverless-artillery) to identify bottlenecks and understand scaling behavior under load."
*   **Benchmarking:** "Explain the practice of benchmarking different configurations (memory sizes, runtimes) or code changes to measure performance impact."
*   **Profiling:** "Mention profiling tools within specific runtimes (e.g., Python's `cProfile`) which can sometimes be used within Lambda, although often requires custom setup."

> **Summary:** "Summarize the key aspects of monitoring (CloudWatch Logs/Metrics, `sam logs`), debugging (local with `sam local --debug`, remote with Logs/X-Ray), and optimization (Lambda memory/cold starts, API caching, DynamoDB capacity, load testing)."
> **Glossary:** "Define: CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Metrics, CloudWatch Alarms, AWS X-Ray, Distributed Tracing, Cold Start, Provisioned Concurrency, Lambda Power Tuning, API Gateway Caching, Load Testing."
> **Quiz:** "Create a quiz covering CloudWatch monitoring tools, `sam logs`, enabling X-Ray, local debugging setup, cold start mitigation, and key optimization areas."
> **Reflective Prompt:** "Ask the learner to consider which monitoring or debugging technique they would prioritize when troubleshooting a slow API endpoint in their SAM application."
