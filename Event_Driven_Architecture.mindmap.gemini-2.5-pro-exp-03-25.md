# Event Driven Architecture #EDA #CoreConcept #Overview
An architectural style that promotes the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events. Systems interact primarily through asynchronous event messages.

## Core Concepts & Fundamentals #Basics #Theory #Definitions
Fundamental ideas underpinning Event Driven Architecture.

### What is an Event? #Event #Definition #Data
A significant change in state represented as a message or record.
Events are immutable facts about something that happened in the past.

#### Event Structure #Format #Payload #Metadata
Common elements within an event message.
##### Event Header #Metadata #Identification
Contains metadata like event ID, timestamp, event type, source.
##### Event Payload #Data #StateChange
Contains the data relevant to the state change that occurred.

### Event Producer (Publisher, Source) #Producer #Publisher #Source
The component that generates and sends events.

### Event Consumer (Subscriber, Sink, Processor) #Consumer #Subscriber #Processor
The component that receives and processes events.

### Event Channel (Topic, Stream, Bus, Queue) #Channel #Topic #Queue #Communication
The medium through which events are transported from producers to consumers.

### Event Broker (Message Broker, Event Bus) #Broker #Middleware #Infrastructure
An intermediary component that routes events from producers to specific consumers.
Manages subscriptions and ensures message delivery.

### Choreography vs Orchestration #Pattern #Coordination #Interaction
Two ways to coordinate interactions in a distributed system.
#### Choreography #Decentralized #Collaboration
Services react to events from others without central control. Relies on components subscribing to events they care about.
#### Orchestration #Centralized #ControlFlow
A central orchestrator component explicitly directs services and manages the flow of interaction (often used with Sagas).

## Key Components & Building Blocks #Architecture #Components #Structure
The main structural elements typically found in an EDA implementation.

### Event Sources #DataSource #Origin
Applications, databases, sensors, UI interactions, etc., that generate events.

### Event Routers / Brokers #Routing #Middleware #Intermediary
Software responsible for receiving events and delivering them to interested consumers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, Pulsar, cloud services).

### Event Processors #Logic #BusinessRules #Processing
Components that subscribe to events and execute business logic based on them.

### Event Sinks #Destination #Storage #Action
Components or systems where the results of event processing are stored or lead to further actions (e.g., databases, data warehouses, APIs, notifications).

## Event Processing Models #Processing #Styles #Models
Different approaches to processing event streams.

### Simple Event Processing (SEP) #Basic #Filtering #Routing
Processing individual events independently for simple tasks like filtering, transformation, and routing.

### Complex Event Processing (CEP) #Complex #Patterns #Correlation
Detecting patterns, correlations, and relationships among multiple events over time to derive higher-level insights or trigger actions.
Uses techniques like windowing, aggregation, and pattern matching.

### Event Stream Processing (ESP) #Streaming #RealTime #Continuous
Continuously processing unbounded streams of event data in real-time or near real-time, often involving transformations, aggregations, and joins over time windows.

## Communication Patterns #Patterns #Interaction #Messaging
Common ways events are communicated between components.

### Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) #PubSub #Decoupling #OneToMany
Producers publish events to a topic/channel without knowledge of subscribers. Multiple subscribers can consume the same event independently.

### Point-to-Point (Queues) #Queue #OneToOne #GuaranteedDelivery
Events (messages) are sent to a queue, and typically only one consumer processes each message. Ensures a message is processed by a single receiver.

### Event Streaming #Streaming #Log #Ordered
Events are written to an append-only log, allowing consumers to read the stream from any point and replay events. Often provides ordering guarantees within partitions. (e.g., Kafka).

### Event Notification #Notification #MinimalData #Callback
Event contains minimal information (e.g., resource ID, event type). Consumers fetch details separately if needed.

### Event-Carried State Transfer #StateTransfer #DataInEvent #SelfContained
Event contains all necessary data for consumers to process it without needing to query the source system. Reduces dependencies but increases coupling via data structure.

## Event Broker / Messaging Infrastructure #Infrastructure #Middleware #Technology
The technology platforms used to manage and transport events.

### Message Queues #Queues #PointToPoint #Broker
Examples: RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, Azure Service Bus Queues, Amazon SQS.
Typically support Point-to-Point and sometimes Pub/Sub.

### Log-Based Brokers #Streaming #Log #Scalability #Durability
Examples: Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar, Amazon Kinesis.
Designed for high-throughput, persistent, ordered event streams.

### Cloud Native Eventing Services #Cloud #Managed #Serverless
Examples: AWS EventBridge, Azure Event Grid, Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
Managed services offering event routing, filtering, and integration capabilities.

### Serverless EDA #Serverless #FaaS #CloudFunctions
Using Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions) as event consumers/processors triggered by event sources or brokers.

## Schema Management & Evolution #Schema #Contracts #Versioning
Managing the structure (schema) of events and handling changes over time.

### Schema Definition Formats #Formats #Serialization #DataStructure
Languages/formats used to define event structures.
#### Avro #Binary #SchemaEvolution #Compact
#### Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) #Binary #Performance #Google
#### JSON Schema #JSON #TextBased #WebFriendly

### Schema Registry #Registry #Centralized #Governance
A centralized service to store, manage, and retrieve event schemas. Ensures producers and consumers agree on event structures.

### Schema Versioning #Versioning #Evolution #Compatibility
Strategies for managing changes to event schemas over time.

### Schema Compatibility Rules #Compatibility #Rules #Evolution
Ensuring producers and consumers can handle different schema versions.
#### Backward Compatibility #ConsumerSafety #NewProducer
Old consumers can read data produced by new producers.
#### Forward Compatibility #ProducerSafety #NewConsumer
New consumers can read data produced by old producers.
#### Full Compatibility #Bidirectional #Safety
Both backward and forward compatibility.

## State Management in EDA #State #Consistency #Challenges
Handling application state when logic is distributed across event-driven components.

### Challenges with Distributed State #DistributedSystems #Consistency #Complexity
Maintaining consistency and managing state across multiple, independently processing components.

### Approaches to State Management #Techniques #Solutions #StateHandling
#### Local State Stores #Local #Simple #Limited
Each service instance maintains its own state, often in memory or local disk. Simple but prone to loss and inconsistency.
#### Rehydrating State from Event Stream #EventStream #Replay #Reconstruction
Rebuilding state by replaying relevant events from the event stream (common with Event Sourcing).
#### Distributed Databases / Caches #Database #Cache #SharedState
Using external databases or caches accessible by multiple services.
#### State Stores in Stream Processing Frameworks #KafkaStreams #Flink #StatefulProcessing
Frameworks like Kafka Streams or Flink provide built-in mechanisms for managing stateful operations on event streams (e.g., KTables, managed state).

## Testing Strategies for EDA #Testing #Quality #Validation
Methods and challenges for testing event-driven systems.

### Unit Testing #Isolation #ComponentTest
Testing individual components (producers, consumers, processors) in isolation. Mocking event sources and sinks.

### Integration Testing #Interaction #BrokerTest #Challenges
Testing the interaction between components, often involving the event broker. Can be complex to set up and manage.
#### Consumer-Driven Contracts #Contracts #CDC #Pact
Consumers define contracts (expectations) for events they need; producers verify they adhere to these contracts. Helps ensure compatibility without full end-to-end tests.
#### Mocking Event Brokers #Simulation #TestEnvironment
Using in-memory or specialized test versions of brokers.

### End-to-End Testing #SystemTest #Flow #Complexity
Testing complete business flows across multiple components and the event broker. Often brittle and slow.

### Testing for Non-Functional Requirements #Performance #Reliability #Scalability
Load testing, failure injection (chaos engineering), testing resilience.

## Monitoring and Observability #Monitoring #Observability #Debugging
Understanding the behavior and health of event-driven systems in production.

## Advanced Topics & Patterns #Advanced #Patterns #Techniques
More sophisticated concepts and patterns used within EDA.

### Event Sourcing #EventSourcing #State #AuditLog
Persisting the state of an entity as a sequence of state-changing events, rather than storing the current state directly. Provides a full audit log and allows rebuilding state at any point in time.

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) #CQRS #Separation #Optimization
Separating the model used for updating information (Commands) from the model used for reading information (Queries). Often used alongside Event Sourcing.

### Saga Pattern #Saga #DistributedTransactions #Coordination
A pattern for managing distributed transactions across multiple services using a sequence of local transactions coordinated via events (Choreography) or a central orchestrator (Orchestration).

### Outbox Pattern #Outbox #Reliability #Atomicity
Ensuring atomicity between database state changes and event publishing by writing events to an "outbox" table within the same transaction as the state change. A separate process then relays these events to the broker.

### Idempotency #Idempotency #Reliability #ExactlyOnceSimulated
Designing consumers so that processing the same event multiple times has the same effect as processing it once. Crucial for handling retries and potential duplicate deliveries.

### Event Streaming Platforms #Streaming #Platforms #RealTimeProcessing
