    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

    contract SimpleToken {
        string public name = "SimpleToken";
        string public symbol = "STK";
        uint8 public decimals = 18;
        uint256 public totalSupply = 1000000 * (10**uint256(decimals));
        mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf;

        constructor() {
            balanceOf[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
        }
    }
    ```

### Deploying and Testing Smart Contracts
*   Using tools like Remix IDE, Truffle, and Ganache.

### Understanding Gas and Gas Optimization
*   Minimizing transaction costs.

## Smart Contract Security

### Common Vulnerabilities
*   Reentrancy attacks, integer overflows, timestamp dependence.

### Security Best Practices
*   Using secure coding patterns, conducting code audits.

### Auditing Smart Contracts
*   Importance of independent security reviews.
