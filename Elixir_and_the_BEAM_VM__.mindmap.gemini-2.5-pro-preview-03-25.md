# Elixir and the BEAM VM #Overview #Ecosystem
Introduction to the Elixir language and its relationship with the underlying Erlang/OTP ecosystem and the BEAM virtual machine.

## Introduction to BEAM #History #VirtualMachine #Erlang
The Erlang Virtual Machine (VM), originally Bogdan's Erlang Abstract Machine.

### History and Design Goals #Ericsson #Telecom #Reliability
Designed for telecommunication systems requiring extreme uptime and concurrency.

### Key Characteristics #Concurrency #FaultTolerance #Distribution #SoftRealtime

### Distribution #Clustering #NodeCommunication #LocationTransparency
BEAM nodes can connect to form clusters, enabling distributed applications where message passing across nodes is nearly seamless.

### Soft Real-time Capabilities #LowLatency #Predictability #Preemption
Preemptive scheduler ensures fairness and responsiveness, suitable for soft real-time systems.
