# I. Introduction to Game Theory

## Understanding Basic Concepts

### Defining a Game
*   Players, strategies, payoffs.
*   Example: Prisoner's Dilemma.

### Types of Games
*   Cooperative vs. Non-cooperative.
*   Simultaneous vs. Sequential.
*   Zero-sum vs. Non-zero-sum.

## Representing Games

### Normal Form (Matrix Form)
*   Representing games with payoff matrices.
*   Example: Rock, Paper, Scissors.

### Extensive Form (Game Trees)
*   Representing sequential games with decision trees.
*   Example: Tic-Tac-Toe (simplified).

# II. Dominance and Equilibrium

## Dominant Strategies

### Identifying Dominant Strategies
*   Definition and implications.
*   Example: Finding dominant strategies in a payoff matrix.

### Iterated Elimination of Dominated Strategies (IEDS)
*   The process of simplifying games.
*   Example: Applying IEDS to a complex game.

## Nash Equilibrium

### Definition and Properties
*   Understanding the concept of best response.
*   Example: Finding Nash Equilibria in Prisoner's Dilemma.

### Finding Nash Equilibria

#### Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium
*   Locating pure strategy equilibria in a matrix.
*   Example: Applying best response analysis to find equilibria.

#### Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium
*   Calculating mixed strategy probabilities.
*   Example: Finding the mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium in Matching Pennies.

# III. Game Theory Applications

## Oligopoly Models

### Cournot Competition
*   Firms competing on quantity.
*   Example: Determining equilibrium quantities and profits in a duopoly.

### Bertrand Competition
*   Firms competing on price.
*   Example: Analyzing the Bertrand Paradox.

## Bargaining Games

### The Nash Bargaining Solution
*   Axioms and derivation.
*   Example: Splitting a pie fairly between two players.

### Ultimatum Game
*   Experimental evidence and deviations from rationality.
*   Example: Analyzing offers and rejections in the ultimatum game.

## Evolutionary Game Theory

### Basic Concepts
*   Evolutionarily Stable Strategies (ESS).
*   Example: Hawk-Dove game and its ESS.

### Replicator Dynamics
*   Modeling how strategies evolve over time.
*   Example: Simulating the evolution of strategies in a population.

# IV. Advanced Topics

## Games with Incomplete Information

### Bayesian Games
*   Players having private information.
*   Example: Auction theory and bidding strategies.

### Mechanism Design
*   Designing games to achieve desired outcomes.
*   Example: Implementing efficient allocation mechanisms.

## Repeated Games

### Finitely Repeated Games
*   Backward induction and the unraveling problem.
*   Example: Analyzing repeated Prisoner's Dilemma.

### Infinitely Repeated Games
*   Trigger strategies and the Folk Theorem.
*   Example: Sustaining cooperation through grim trigger strategies.
