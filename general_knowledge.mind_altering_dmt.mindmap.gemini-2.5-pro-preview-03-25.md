# Mind Altering DMT #Overview #Psychedelic

N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a potent, naturally occurring psychedelic tryptamine found in numerous plants and animals, including trace amounts in humans. It is known for inducing intense, short-lived hallucinogenic experiences and has a long history of use in traditional spiritual practices, particularly in South America.

## Introduction and Overview #Basics #Definition #History

## Pharmacology and Pharmacokinetics #Pharmacology #Neuroscience #Receptors
How DMT interacts with the body and brain.
### Mechanism of Action #Neuropharmacology #Receptors
Pharmacology is not fully understood but involves multiple receptor systems. [3, 10]
#### Serotonin Receptors #Serotonin #5HT
##### 5-HT2A Receptor Agonism #Receptor #Hallucinations
Considered crucial for hallucinogenic effects, but likely not sufficient alone. [3, 10, 19] Modulates dopamine and adrenaline. [14]
##### Other Serotonin Receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT2C) #Receptor #Modulation
May play important roles. [3, 10] 5-HT1A blockade magnifies effects. [20]
#### Sigma-1 Receptors #Receptor #Neuroprotection
DMT is a sigma-1 agonist. Interaction may relate to neuroprotective effects and modulation of immune function. [3, 10, 18, 20]
#### Trace Amine-Associated Receptors (TAAR1) #Receptor #TAAR
Binds with high affinity, activates adenylyl cyclase. Role unclear. [3, 23]
#### Glutamate Receptors #Receptor #Glutamate
Some evidence suggests a role. [3, 10]
#### Other Receptor Interactions #Neurotransmitter
May interact with dopamine, acetylcholine receptors. [3] Substrate for SERT and VMAT2. [31]
### Pharmacokinetics #Absorption #Metabolism #Duration
#### Routes of Administration #Ingestion #Smoking #Injection
##### Inhalation (Smoking/Vaporizing) #Smoking #FastOnset
Rapid onset (10-15 seconds), short duration (usually < 30 mins). Standard dose 20-60 mg. [1]
##### Injection (Intravenous/Intramuscular) #Injection #FastOnset
IV: Very rapid onset (≤2-5 min), short duration (< 30 mins). [1, 14]
IM: Rapid onset (2-5 min). [1, 14]
##### Oral (with MAOI) #Oral #Ayahuasca #SlowOnset
Generally inactive orally due to rapid metabolism by MAO-A. [1, 4] Requires Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) like harmala alkaloids (harmine, harmaline) found in Ayahuasca. [1, 4, 7] Onset ≤1 hour, duration >3 hours. [1]
##### Insufflation (Snorting) #Snorting #Uncommon [1, 2]
##### Rectal #Rectal #Uncommon [1]
#### Metabolism #Enzymes #MAO
##### Monoamine Oxidase A (MAO-A) #Enzyme #Breakdown
Primary metabolic pathway, rapidly breaks down DMT, especially when taken orally. [1, 3, 23]
##### Metabolites #Biochemistry #BreakdownProducts
Major metabolites: Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), DMT-N-oxide (DMT-NO). [1, 3, 23] Other metabolites include NMT, 6-OH-DMT. [3] Metabolites generally inactive. [3]
#### Duration of Effects #Psychedelic #Timecourse
##### Smoked/Injected #ShortDuration
Typically less than 30-45 minutes. [1, 4]
##### Oral (with MAOI) #LongDuration
Can last 3 hours or more. [1]
#### Tolerance #Pharmacology #Tachyphylaxis
Unlike other classic psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin), significant tolerance to subjective effects does not seem to develop quickly. [1, 18, 31] No cross-tolerance with LSD observed. [1] Some physiological responses (heart rate) may show tolerance. [1]

## Neurobiology and Endogenous Role #Neuroscience #Brain #Endogenous
DMT's role in the brain, including natural production theories.
### Endogenous Production #Brain #PinealGland #Hypothesis
DMT is produced naturally in small amounts in mammals, including humans. [1, 3, 18]
#### Biosynthesis Pathway #Enzymes #Tryptophan
Synthesized from tryptophan via AADC and INMT. [3, 23]
#### Location of Synthesis #BrainRegions #INMT
INMT enzyme/mRNA found in cerebral cortex, choroid plexus, pineal gland, retina, spinal cord. [1, 20] DMT detected in pineal gland of living rats. [20]
#### Measured Levels #Concentration #BodyFluids
Found in low concentrations in brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, urine. [3] Levels don't appear regulated by diet/gut bacteria. [3] Difficult to determine if production is phasic/diurnal. [3]
### Hypothesized Endogenous Functions #Theories #Consciousness #Physiology
Biological function remains largely unknown and speculative. [3, 29]
#### Role in Consciousness/Perception #Mind #Perception #Theory
Speculative hypotheses link endogenous DMT to dreaming, mystical experiences, near-death experiences (NDEs), creativity. [1, 20, 29] Parallels noted between DMT experiences and NDEs. [18, 29]
#### Stress Response #Stress #Physiology
Production may increase under stress (observed in rodents). [3] Link suggested between cardiac arrest and increased DMT levels in rat visual cortex. [29]
#### Psychiatric Conditions (Transmethylation Hypothesis) #Psychosis #Schizophrenia #History
Early hypothesis (1950s) suggested endogenous hallucinogens like DMT might cause symptoms of psychosis (e.g., schizophrenia). [1, 20] Evidence remains inconclusive; DMT detected in healthy controls more than patients. [3]
#### Neuroprotection/Neurogenesis #BrainHealth #Plasticity
Interaction with Sigma-1 receptors suggests potential neuroprotective roles. [16, 18] May promote neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. [16, 24, 27]
#### Immune Regulation #Immunology #Physiology
Potential roles suggested. [18] Reduces chronic inflammation in CNS (research needed). [16]
#### Ancestral Neuromodulator Hypothesis #Evolution #REM #Theory
Gallimore (2013) suggested DMT may have been secreted during REM sleep ancestrally, a function now lost. [1]
