Learning Objectives: Understand basic circuit elements, circuit laws, AC circuit analysis, semiconductor devices, op-amps, and digital logic.

Prerequisites: Basic algebra, introductory physics concepts (electricity and magnetism).

Depth & Scope: Overview of fundamental concepts in circuit analysis and electronics.

Target Audience: Electrical Engineering students or hobbyists.

Technical Details: Ohm's Law (`V = IR`), KVL, KCL, Thevenin's/Norton's Theorems, diode equation (`I = Is * (exp(V/(nVt)) - 1)`), Op-Amp gain formulas (`Av = -Rf/Rin`, `Av = 1 + Rf/Rin`).

Relevant Technologies/Tools: N/A (theoretical concepts).

Preferred Format/Length: Detailed explanations with concise examples for each concept.
