Whitelisting expected algorithms is crucial. Format as a paragraph with mitigation starting at heading level 2."

### `none` Algorithm Attack
"<prompt>Describe the attack where an attacker sets the `alg` header to `none` and removes the signature part entirely.

Warn against placing sensitive information (PII, confidential data) directly in the JWS payload. **Mitigation:** Use JWE if payload confidentiality is required; minimize the data included in any JWT payload, especially JWS. Format as a paragraph with mitigation starting at heading level 2."

### Token Theft (XSS, CSRF, Insecure Storage)
"<prompt>Explain the risks of JWTs being stolen from the client-side, e.g., through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks accessing `localStorage`, or via insecure storage mechanisms. Mention CSRF risks if tokens are stored in cookies without proper protection. **Mitigation:** Recommend storing tokens in `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite` cookies to mitigate XSS and CSRF. If using web storage, implement robust XSS protection (e.g., Content Security Policy - CSP). Avoid `localStorage` for sensitive tokens. Format as a paragraph with mitigation starting at heading level 2."

### Replay Attacks
"<prompt>Describe replay attacks, where an attacker intercepts a valid JWT and reuses it later to gain unauthorized access. **Mitigation:** Implement short expiration times (`exp` claim). Use the `jti` (JWT ID) claim to uniquely identify each token and maintain a server-side list of processed/invalidated `jti`s (adds state). Consider using nonce values for specific transactions. Format as a paragraph with mitigation starting at heading level 2."

### Expiration (`exp`) and Not Before (`nbf`) Handling
"<prompt>Discuss issues related to improper validation of time-based claims (`exp`, `nbf`). Mention the impact of clock skew between the issuing server and the verifying server. **Mitigation:** Always validate `exp` and `nbf` claims rigorously. Allow for a small, configurable clock skew tolerance during validation. Ensure servers synchronize their clocks using protocols like NTP. Format as a paragraph with mitigation starting at heading level 2."

### Token Revocation Challenges
"<prompt>Explain the inherent challenge of revoking JWTs before their expiration date, especially in a stateless architecture. Discuss scenarios requiring revocation (logout, password change, suspected compromise). **Mitigation:** Use short token lifetimes as the primary mitigation. For more immediate revocation needs, implement server-side revocation lists (blocklists) based on `jti` or `sub` (this introduces state). Consider using a Refresh Token pattern where refresh tokens can be revoked more easily. Format as a paragraph with mitigation starting at heading level 2."

### Header Parameter Injection (`jku`, `x5u`, `kid`)
"<prompt>Describe vulnerabilities where attackers manipulate header parameters like `jku` (JWK Set URL), `x5u` (X.509 URL), or even `kid` (Key ID) to point the verifier towards malicious keys or certificates controlled by the attacker. **Mitigation:** Never blindly trust URLs or key IDs provided in the token header. Verifiers should maintain a strict whitelist of trusted key sources (URLs, issuer identifiers) or pre-configure expected keys. Validate certificate chains thoroughly if using X.509 parameters. Format as a paragraph with mitigation starting at heading level 2."

### Timing Attacks during Verification
"<prompt>Briefly explain the concept of timing attacks, where subtle differences in the time taken for cryptographic operations (like signature comparison) might leak information about the secret or key. **Mitigation:** Ensure the cryptographic libraries used perform signature and hash comparisons using constant-time algorithms to prevent such side-channel attacks. Format as a paragraph with mitigation starting at heading level 2."

*   **Critical Highlight:** "<prompt>Create a prominent callout box stating: 'Never trust data received in a JWT header or payload *before* cryptographically verifying the token's signature (for JWS) or decrypting it (for JWE) using trusted keys and explicitly configured algorithms.'

### Use Strong Secrets and Keys
"<prompt>Reinforce the practice of using cryptographically strong, unpredictable secrets for HMAC algorithms and sufficiently long, randomly generated keys for asymmetric algorithms (RSA, EC). Mention entropy requirements. Format as a concise recommendation starting at heading level 2."

### Implement Key Rotation
"<prompt>Recommend the practice of regularly rotating signing and encryption keys to limit the impact of a potential key compromise. Advise having a clear process for generating new keys and phasing out old ones gracefully (e.g., allowing validation with old keys for a transition period). Format as a concise recommendation starting at heading level 2."

### Choose Appropriate Algorithms
"<prompt>Advise selecting signing (`alg`) and encryption (`alg`/`enc`) algorithms based on specific security requirements, performance considerations, and the system architecture (e.g., symmetric vs. asymmetric). Explicitly recommend avoiding known weak or deprecated algorithms and the `none` algorithm unless absolutely necessary and understood. Format as a concise recommendation starting at heading level 2."

### Validate ALL Relevant Claims
"<prompt>Stress the importance of validating *all* relevant claims during token processing. Mandate checking the signature/integrity first, then validating `iss` (issuer), `aud` (audience - ensuring the token is for *this* service), `exp` (expiration), and `nbf` (not before). Also, validate any application-specific claims (`sub`, roles, permissions) required for business logic. Format as a concise recommendation starting at heading level 2."

### Always Use HTTPS
"<prompt>Mandate the transmission of JWTs *only* over secure channels (HTTPS/TLS) to prevent eavesdropping and token interception in transit. Explain that even signed/encrypted tokens can leak information or be captured if transmitted over plain HTTP. Format as a concise recommendation starting at heading level 2."

### Secure Token Storage on the Client-Side
"<prompt>Provide guidance on securely storing JWTs on the client-side. Strongly recommend using `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict` (or `Lax`) cookies as the default to mitigate XSS and CSRF risks. Discourage storing sensitive tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` due to XSS vulnerability. Emphasize using appropriate XSS countermeasures (CSP) if web storage is unavoidable.

### Keep Payload Minimal
"<prompt>Recommend including only the necessary claims in the JWT payload. Explain that this reduces token size (improving performance) and minimizes potential information disclosure, especially for JWS where the payload is readable. Format as a concise recommendation starting at heading level 2."

### Implement Token Expiration and Renewal
"<prompt>Advise using short lifetimes for access tokens (`exp` claim) to limit the window for replay attacks and compromised tokens. Recommend implementing a token renewal mechanism, often using longer-lived but securely stored Refresh Tokens, to provide a better user experience without sacrificing security. Format as a concise recommendation starting at heading level 2."

### Have a Token Revocation Strategy
"<prompt>Recommend carefully considering whether token revocation is necessary for the application's security posture. If needed, choose an appropriate strategy (e.g., short lifetimes, server-side blocklist based on `jti`, relying on refresh token revocation). Acknowledge the trade-off between statelessness and the ability to immediately revoke tokens. Format as a concise recommendation starting at heading level 2."

### Explicitly Specify Algorithms and Keys on Verification
"<prompt>Reiterate the critical security practice for verifiers: **Do not trust the `alg` header alone.** Explicitly configure and enforce the *expected* algorithm(s) and use the corresponding correct key(s) (public key for RS/ES/PS, shared secret for HS) for verification based on the token's context (e.g., its issuer or source). Format as a concise recommendation with emphasis starting at heading level 2."
