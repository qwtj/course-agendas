Context: AWS Glue Recommendations.</llm_prompt>"

## Development Workflow Best Practices
"<llm_prompt>Outline recommended best practices for the development workflow of AWS Glue jobs, starting the response with a level 2 heading. Suggest practices like code reviews, implementing unit/integration tests (potentially using local development setups or Development Endpoints), using version control (e.g., Git), considering CI/CD pipelines for deployment, and defining infrastructure as code (IaC) using CloudFormation or CDK. Context: AWS Glue Recommendations.</llm_prompt>"

## Section XIV Summary
"<llm_prompt>Generate a concise summary paragraph highlighting common AWS Glue Use Cases (Data Warehousing, Data Lakes, Serverless Integration) and reiterating the key areas of best practices: Security, Performance, Cost Optimization, and Development Workflow, starting the response with a level 2 heading. Context: AWS Glue ETL.</llm_prompt>"

## Section XIV Self-Assessment Quiz
"<llm_prompt>Create a short quiz (3-5 questions) assessing understanding of Glue use cases and best practices, covering scenarios like data lake ETL, the role of Glue in enabling Athena queries, and key recommendations from security/performance/cost areas, starting the response with a level 2 heading. Provide answers separately. Context: AWS Glue Use Cases and Best Practices.</llm_prompt>"

## Section XIV Further Exploration
"<llm_prompt>Provide 2-3 relevant AWS documentation links, whitepapers, or solution briefs showcasing specific AWS Glue use cases (e.g., building a serverless data lake) or detailing best practices across different domains (security, cost, performance), starting the response with a level 2 heading. Context: AWS Glue Use Cases and Best Practices.</llm_prompt>"

## Section XIV Reflection Prompt
"<llm_prompt>Generate a reflection question asking the learner to choose one specific best practice (e.g., data partitioning, using Flex execution, implementing IaC) and explain how applying it could improve a hypothetical AWS Glue project, starting the response with a level 2 heading. Context: AWS Glue Best Practices Application.</llm_prompt>"
