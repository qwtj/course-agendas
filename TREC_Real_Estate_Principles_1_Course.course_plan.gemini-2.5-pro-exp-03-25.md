*   "<prompt>Provide practice problems calculating acreage from dimensions in feet and calculating the number of acres in parts of a section (e.g., calculate the acreage of the S 1/2 of the NW 1/4 of a section).</prompt>"

### 2. Structure Measurement
"<prompt>Explain common standards for measuring residential property square footage (e.g., ANSI standards often cited), focusing on heated and cooled living area (GLA) and distinguishing it from non-living areas like garages or patios.</prompt>"
*   "<prompt>Describe how inconsistencies in measuring square footage can lead to disputes or misrepresentations.</prompt>"

> **Key Point:** An accurate legal description is crucial for conveying title; a street address is insufficient for legal purposes.

*   **Self-Assessment Quiz:**
    "<prompt>Generate a 5-question quiz covering the three main types of legal descriptions (metes/bounds, rectangular survey, lot/block) and basic area calculation concepts (acre, section).</prompt>"

*   "<prompt>Explain why escheat is relatively rare but represents an ultimate government power over property.</prompt>"

> **Key Point:** Government regulations, particularly zoning and environmental laws, can significantly restrict how a property owner can use their land.

*   **Self-Assessment Quiz:**
    "<prompt>Generate a 6-question multiple-choice quiz covering the four government powers (PETE), zoning concepts (variance, nonconforming use), building codes, eminent domain, and property taxation.</prompt>"

*   **Summary:** This section covered the four fundamental government powers (Police Power, Eminent Domain, Taxation, Escheat - PETE) that limit private property rights and control land use through mechanisms like zoning, building codes, environmental laws, and taxation.

*   **Reflection Prompt:**
    "<prompt>Generate a prompt asking the learner to reflect on the balance between protecting private property rights and the government's need to regulate for the public good (e.g., zoning, environmental protection).</prompt>"

---
**(Section Transition):** Having explored ownership, description, and government controls, we turn to the crucial process of transferring property ownership.

### 2. Involuntary Alienation
"<prompt>Explain 'involuntary alienation' (transfer of title without the owner's consent), citing examples like 'eminent domain' (condemnation), 'foreclosure' (mortgage or tax lien), 'adverse possession', and 'escheat'.</prompt>" (Cross-reference: See Sections IV.B, IV.C, IV.D).

*   "<prompt>List common exclusions found in standard title insurance policies.</prompt>"

> **Key Point:** A General Warranty Deed offers the most comprehensive protection to the buyer (grantee), as the seller (grantor) warrants the title against all defects, even those originating before their ownership.

*   **Self-Assessment Quiz:**
    "<prompt>Generate a 7-question multiple-choice quiz covering voluntary/involuntary alienation, requirements for a valid deed, types of deeds (General Warranty, Special Warranty, Quitclaim), recording, abstracts, and title insurance.</prompt>"

### 3. Amendments and Addenda
"<prompt>Differentiate between an 'amendment' (changes an existing contract term) and an 'addendum' (adds new terms or information). Explain the proper use of TREC-approved amendment and addenda forms.</prompt>"
*   "<prompt>Give an example of when an amendment (e.g., changing the closing date) versus an addendum (e.g., adding a Seller Financing Addendum) would be used.</prompt>"

## C. Breach of Contract and Remedies
"<prompt>Define 'breach of contract' and describe the potential remedies available to the non-breaching party in Texas: 'specific performance', 'monetary damages' (including disposition of earnest money), and 'rescission'.</prompt>"
