# Angular (Latest: v19) #Angular #Framework #WebDevelopment
Angular is a TypeScript-based, open-source framework developed by Google for building scalable web applications. It's known for its component-based architecture and comprehensive ecosystem. The latest version is Angular 19, released around November 2024.

## Introduction & Getting Started #Overview #Setup #Basics
Initial concepts, environment setup, and basic project structure.
### What is Angular? #Definition #SPA #Platform
A platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Developed and maintained by Google.
### Prerequisites #Skills #Setup
Required knowledge (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript) and development environment setup (Node.js, npm/yarn, Angular CLI).
### Angular CLI #Tooling #Commands #Scaffolding
The Command Line Interface for initializing, developing, scaffolding, and maintaining Angular applications. Essential commands (`ng new`, `ng serve`, `ng generate`, `ng build`, `ng test`).
### Project Structure #Files #Folders #Organization
Understanding the default file and folder layout (`src`, `app`, `assets`, `environments`, `angular.json`, `package.json`).

## Core Concepts #Fundamentals #Architecture #BuildingBlocks
The essential building blocks and principles of Angular applications.
### Components #UI #BuildingBlocks #View
Fundamental UI building blocks controlling a patch of the screen (the view). Defined using `@Component` decorator. Includes template, styles, and logic.
#### Component Lifecycle Hooks #Lifecycle #Hooks #Initialization #Destruction
Key moments in a component's life (e.g., `ngOnInit`, `ngOnChanges`, `ngOnDestroy`).
#### Component Interaction #Input #Output #Communication
Passing data between components using `@Input()` and `@Output()` with `EventEmitter`.
### Templates #HTML #View #Syntax
HTML enhanced with Angular's binding syntax and directives to display component data and respond to user events.
#### Template Syntax #Interpolation #Binding #Expressions
Using `{{ }}` for interpolation, `[]` for property binding, `()` for event binding.
#### Data Binding #Synchronization #ModelView
Mechanisms to synchronize data between the component's model and the template view.
##### Property Binding `[]` #DataFlow #ComponentToDOM
Binding component properties to DOM element properties.
##### Event Binding `()` #UserInteraction #DOMToComponent
Responding to DOM events and calling component methods.
##### Two-Way Binding `[()]` (ngModel) #Forms #Synchronization
Combining property and event binding for form elements.
### Directives #DOMManipulation #Behavior #Appearance
Classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications. Identified by `@Directive` decorator.
#### Built-in Directives #Core #Common #Structural #Attribute
Common directives like `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`, `[ngClass]`, `[ngStyle]`.
#### Custom Directives #Extensibility #ReusableBehavior
Creating reusable custom directives for specific DOM manipulations or behaviors.
#### Structural Directives #DOMStructure #ngIf #ngFor
Directives that shape or reshape the DOM's structure, typically by adding, removing, or manipulating elements (e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`).
#### Attribute Directives #ElementBehavior #Appearance
Directives that change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive (e.g., `ngClass`, `ngStyle`).
### Modules (NgModules - Less emphasized since v17) #Organization #Compilation #DeprecatedConcept
Historically used to configure the injector and compilation context (`@NgModule`). Standalone components are now the default and preferred approach since Angular 17.
#### Standalone Components #Default #Simplicity #ModulesOptional
Components, directives, and pipes that manage their own template dependencies directly, reducing boilerplate. Default since v17.
### Services #BusinessLogic #Data #SharedCode
Classes for organizing and sharing business logic, models, or data and functions with different components using Dependency Injection. Defined using `@Injectable`.
### Dependency Injection (DI) #Decoupling #Testability #Services
A core design pattern where components receive their dependencies (like services) from an external source (the injector) rather than creating them.
#### Injectors #Providers #HierarchicalDI
Understanding the injector hierarchy and how to provide services.

## Routing & Navigation #SPA #Navigation #StateManagement
Managing navigation between different views or components in a single-page application.
### Angular Router #Library #Configuration #Navigation
Using `@angular/router` to define navigation paths and associated components.
### Route Configuration #Routes #Paths #Components
Defining routes in `app.routes.ts` (or `app-routing.module.ts` historically). Mapping paths to components.
### RouterOutlet #Placeholder #ViewRendering
The directive (`<router-outlet>`) acting as a placeholder where the router renders the matched component.
### RouterLink #NavigationDirective #Links
Directive (`routerLink`) for declarative navigation using anchor tags.
### Route Parameters #DynamicData #PassingData
Passing data as part of the URL path (e.g., `/products/:id`).
### Route Guards #Security #AccessControl #Lifecycle
Protecting routes based on conditions (e.g., `CanActivate`, `CanDeactivate`).
### Lazy Loading #Performance #Optimization #Modules
Loading parts of the application (routes/modules/components) only when needed.
### Server Route Configuration (Experimental v19) #HybridRendering #SSR #Performance
API for defining server-side, pre-rendered, or client-side rendering modes per route.

## Forms #UserInput #DataCollection #Validation
Handling user input through forms.
### Template-Driven Forms #SimpleForms #ngModel #Directives
Forms where logic, validation, and controls are primarily managed in the template using directives like `ngModel`. Suitable for simpler forms.
### Reactive Forms #ComplexForms #Programmatic #FormControl
Forms where the form model (structure, controls, validation) is explicitly defined and managed in the component class. Offers more control and testability. Suitable for complex forms.
#### Form Controls #FormControl #FormGroup #FormArray

#### Validation #SyncValidation #AsyncValidation #Validators
Implementing synchronous and asynchronous validation rules.
