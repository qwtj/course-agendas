# I. Introduction to gRPC

## Understanding Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)

### Traditional RPC mechanisms and limitations.
### Evolution towards modern RPC frameworks.

## Introducing gRPC: Origins and Motivation

### Developed by Google; open-sourced.
### Addressing challenges in distributed systems.

## Key Features of gRPC

### High performance: leverages HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers.
### Strongly-typed interfaces: ensures consistency and reduces errors.
### Code generation: simplifies development across multiple languages.
### Bi-directional streaming: supports real-time communication.

## gRPC vs. REST: Comparison

### Architectural differences: RPC vs. resource-oriented.
### Performance characteristics: benchmarking considerations.
### Use cases: suitability for different application types.

# II. Protocol Buffers (protobuf)

## Understanding Protocol Buffers

### Definition: A language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.
### Benefits: smaller data size, faster serialization/deserialization, schema evolution.

## Defining a Protocol Buffer Schema (`.proto` file)

### Message definition: specifying fields, data types, and numbering.
    * Example: `message Person { string name = 1; int32 id = 2; string email = 3; }`
### Data types: primitive types (int32, string, bool, etc.) and complex types (nested messages, enums).
### Enum definition: creating enumerated types for representing a set of named values.
    * Example: `enum PhoneType { MOBILE = 0; HOME = 1; WORK = 2; }`
### Importing other `.proto` files: organizing schemas into modular files.

## Compiling Protocol Buffers

### Using the `protoc` compiler: generating code for different languages.
### Compiler options: specifying the output language and directory.
    * Example: `protoc --python_out=. my_service.proto`

## Working with Generated Code

### Accessing message fields: setting and retrieving data.
### Serialization and Deserialization: converting messages to/from byte streams.
### Working with enums: using enum values in your code.

# III. Building gRPC Services

## Defining gRPC Services in `.proto` files

### Service definition: specifying methods and their input/output types.
    * Example: `service Greeter { rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {} }`
### Unary RPC: a single request and a single response.
### Server Streaming RPC: a single request followed by a stream of responses.
### Client Streaming RPC: a stream of requests followed by a single response.
### Bi-directional Streaming RPC: a stream of requests and a stream of responses.

## Implementing gRPC Servers

### Generating server stubs: using `protoc` to create server-side code.
### Implementing service methods: handling requests and returning responses.
### Starting a gRPC server: binding to a port and listening for connections.

## Implementing gRPC Clients

### Generating client stubs: using `protoc` to create client-side code.
### Creating a gRPC channel: establishing a connection to the server.
### Calling service methods: sending requests and receiving responses.
### Handling errors: dealing with exceptions and status codes.

## Example: Unary RPC Service (Greeter Service)

### Define `HelloRequest` and `HelloReply` messages.
### Implement the `SayHello` method on the server.
### Create a client to call the `SayHello` method and print the response.

# IV. Advanced gRPC Concepts

## Metadata

### Purpose: passing additional information (authentication tokens, tracing IDs, etc.) with RPC calls.
### Adding metadata to requests: including metadata in client-side calls.
### Accessing metadata on the server: retrieving metadata from incoming requests.

## Interceptors

### Purpose: adding cross-cutting functionality (logging, authentication, authorization, etc.) to gRPC calls.
### Server-side interceptors: intercepting incoming requests.
### Client-side interceptors: intercepting outgoing requests.

## Deadlines and Cancellation

### Setting deadlines: specifying a time limit for RPC calls.
### Cancelling RPC calls: terminating long-running or unnecessary requests.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Transport Layer Security (TLS): securing gRPC connections.
### Authentication methods: using API keys, OAuth 2.0, or other authentication schemes.
### Authorization: controlling access to gRPC services based on user roles or permissions.

## Error Handling

### gRPC status codes: using standard status codes to indicate errors.
### Returning detailed error information: providing additional context to clients.
### Handling errors on the client: gracefully handling errors and retrying requests.

## Load Balancing

### Client-side load balancing: distributing requests across multiple server instances.
### Service discovery: finding available server instances using DNS or other mechanisms.
### Using a load balancer: deploying a dedicated load balancer (e.g., Envoy) to distribute traffic.
