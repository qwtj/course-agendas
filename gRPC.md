# I. Introduction to gRPC

## Overview of gRPC
"Explain what gRPC is, its origins, and its primary goals."

## Key Concepts of gRPC
"Define the core concepts of gRPC, including Protocol Buffers (Protobuf), service definitions, remote procedure calls, and the use of HTTP/2."

### Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)
"Describe Protocol Buffers, their syntax, and how they are used to define service interfaces and message formats in gRPC."
* "Provide an example of a simple Protobuf definition for a 'Greeter' service with a 'SayHello' method."

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package example;

service Greeter {
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}
}

message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

### Service Definitions
"Explain how service definitions are structured in Protobuf and how they define the available remote procedures."
* "Illustrate how RPC methods are defined within a service definition, including their request and response types."

### Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
"Detail how gRPC uses RPC to enable communication between client and server applications."
* "Explain the difference between unary RPCs, server streaming RPCs, client streaming RPCs, and bidirectional streaming RPCs."

### HTTP/2
"Explain why gRPC uses HTTP/2 and the advantages it offers over HTTP/1.1, such as multiplexing, header compression, and binary transport."

## Benefits of Using gRPC
"Summarize the key benefits of using gRPC, including improved performance, strong typing, code generation, and support for multiple languages."

## gRPC vs. REST
"Compare and contrast gRPC with REST, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and when to choose one over the other."

**Summary:** gRPC is a high-performance, open-source RPC framework that uses Protocol Buffers for message serialization and HTTP/2 for transport. It offers benefits like strong typing, code generation, and support for multiple languages, making it suitable for building efficient and scalable microservices.
