# React #JavaScriptLibrary #UI #Frontend
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.

## Core Concepts & Fundamentals #Basics #Introduction #Core
Fundamental principles and ideas behind React.

### What is React? #Definition #Library #UI
Explanation of React's purpose and its role as a UI library.

### Declarative Programming #Paradigm #UI #Efficiency
React allows you to describe *what* the UI should look like based on data, and it handles updating the DOM efficiently.

### Component-Based Architecture #Modularity #Reusability #Encapsulation
Building UIs from small, isolated pieces of code called components.

### Virtual DOM #Performance #Optimization #DOM
React uses a virtual representation of the DOM to minimize direct DOM manipulations, improving performance.

### One-Way Data Binding #DataFlow #Predictability #StateManagement
Data flows down from parent to child components via props.

## Setting Up a React Environment #Setup #Tooling #Development

## JSX (JavaScript XML) #Syntax #Templating #Readability
A syntax extension for JavaScript recommended for use with React, allowing you to write HTML-like structures in your JavaScript code.

### JSX Syntax Basics #Elements #Attributes #Expressions
How to write JSX elements, use attributes (like `className`), and embed JavaScript expressions `{}`.

### JSX vs. HTML #Differences #Gotchas #Attributes
Key differences like `className` vs. `class`, `htmlFor` vs. `for`, and self-closing tags.

### JSX Represents Objects #Transpilation #Babel #ReactElement
JSX compiles down to `React.createElement()` calls, which create React element objects.

## Components #BuildingBlocks #UI #Reusability
The core units of UI in React applications.

### Function Components #Modern #Hooks #Simplicity
The standard way to write components using JavaScript functions, especially with Hooks.

### Class Components #Legacy #Stateful #LifecycleMethods
The older way to write components using ES6 classes (less common for new code but important for existing codebases).

### Component Naming Conventions #PascalCase #Clarity #Readability
Best practices for naming component files and the components themselves.

### Component Composition #Reusability #DesignPattern #Relationships
Building complex UIs by combining simpler components.

## Props (Properties) #DataPassing #Configuration #ParentChild
How components receive data and configuration from their parent components.

### Passing Props #Syntax #DataFlow #Communication
Sending data down the component tree.

### Receiving Props #FunctionArguments #this.props #AccessingData
Accessing passed props within function and class components.

### `props.children` #Composition #ContentProjection #Flexibility
A special prop used to pass child elements directly into a component's output.

### Prop Types & Default Props #Validation #Debugging #Robustness
Using libraries like `prop-types` or TypeScript for type checking props and defining default values.

## State #ComponentData #DynamicUI #Management
Data managed *within* a component that can change over time, causing the component to re-render.

### What is State? #Definition #InternalData #Mutability
Understanding the concept of component-local state.

### Using State in Function Components (`useState` Hook) #Hooks #Modern #StateManagement

### Using State in Class Components (`this.state`, `setState`) #Legacy #StateManagement #Lifecycle

## Handling Events #UserInteraction #DOMEvents #Callbacks
Responding to user actions like clicks, input changes, form submissions, etc.

## Forms #UserInput #ControlledComponents #DataHandling
Handling user input through form elements like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>`.
