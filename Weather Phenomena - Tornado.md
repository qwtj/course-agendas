# I. Tornado Formation and Dynamics

## Understanding Basic Atmospheric Conditions

### Temperature and Pressure Gradients

*   Role of solar heating and cooling in creating these gradients.
*   Concept of isobars and isotherms and their representation on weather maps.

### Air Mass Interactions

*   Definition of air masses (mT, cT, mP, cP, cA).
*   Formation of fronts (cold, warm, stationary, occluded) due to air mass collisions.
*   Lifting mechanisms associated with fronts (frontal lifting).

### Moisture and Instability

*   Measuring atmospheric moisture: dew point, relative humidity.
*   Concept of atmospheric instability: stable, neutral, and unstable air.
*   Determining stability using temperature lapse rates (environmental vs. adiabatic).
*   Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) and Convective Inhibition (CIN).

## Supercell Thunderstorm Development

### Ingredients for Supercell Formation

*   High CAPE and low CIN environments.
*   Presence of a strong vertical wind shear.
*   Moisture availability in the lower atmosphere.
*   Lifting mechanism (e.g., front, dryline, outflow boundary).

### Mesocyclone Formation

*   Tilting of horizontal vorticity into the vertical by updrafts.
*   Role of wind shear in generating horizontal vorticity.
*   Development of a rotating updraft (mesocyclone).

### Supercell Structure

*   Visual features: wall cloud, flanking line, inflow tail.
*   Radar signatures: hook echo, bounded weak echo region (BWER).
*   Downdrafts: forward flank downdraft (FFD) and rear flank downdraft (RFD).

## Tornado Genesis

### Tornado Formation Mechanisms

*   Dynamic pipe effect: intensification of rotation near the surface.
*   Descending RFD: role in tightening the mesocyclone near the ground.
*   Vortex stretching: increasing rotation rate as vortex diameter decreases.

### Tornado Classification

*   Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale: wind speed estimation based on damage.
*   Multi-vortex tornadoes: existence of multiple vortices within a single tornado.
*   Landspouts and waterspouts: tornadoes not associated with supercells.

### Factors Influencing Tornado Intensity

*   Strength of the mesocyclone.
*   Proximity to the RFD.
*   Surface friction and terrain.

*Summary: Supercell thunderstorms, fueled by specific atmospheric conditions, create rotating mesocyclones. Under the right conditions, these mesocyclones can tighten and descend, resulting in tornado formation. The EF Scale classifies tornadoes based on wind speed estimated by the resultant damage.*

# II. Tornado Prediction and Detection

## Weather Forecasting Fundamentals

### Surface Weather Maps

*   Identifying jet streams and troughs/ridges.
*   Using upper-air data to assess atmospheric stability and wind shear.

### Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) Models

*   Overview of common models: GFS, NAM, HRRR.
*   Interpreting model output: temperature, wind, precipitation, instability indices.

### Radar Signatures of Supercells and Tornadoes

*   Hook echo: indicative of a mesocyclone.
*   Tornado vortex signature (TVS): small-scale rotation within a mesocyclone.

*   Correlation coefficient: Identification of non-meteorological targets, including tornado debris.

### Mobile Radar and Research Applications

*   Deploying mobile radar for high-resolution data collection.
*   Using mobile radar data to study tornado formation and evolution.

*Summary: Predicting tornadoes relies on accurate weather forecasting, the SPC outlooks and watches, and understanding of Doppler radar technology. Using radar signatures, meteorologists can identify and track supercells, mesocyclones, and ultimately, tornadoes.*
