# I. Introduction to Angular

## Understanding Angular Fundamentals

### Introduction to Single Page Applications (SPAs)
*   Define SPAs and their benefits.
*   Contrast SPAs with traditional multi-page applications.
*   Examples: Gmail, Google Maps, Trello.

### The Angular Framework
*   Overview of Angular's architecture and key components.
*   Angular CLI: Installation and usage (`npm install -g @angular/cli`).
*   Angular versions and compatibility.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Installing Node.js and npm
*   Downloading and installing Node.js (including npm).
*   Verifying installation (`node -v`, `npm -v`).

### Installing the Angular CLI
*   Using npm to install the Angular CLI globally (`npm install -g @angular/cli`).
*   Verifying installation (`ng version`).

### Choosing an IDE or Code Editor
*   Recommended IDEs: Visual Studio Code, WebStorm.
*   Setting up extensions for Angular development (e.g., Angular Language Service).

# II. Angular Core Concepts

## Components

### Component Structure
*   Understanding the three parts of a component: template (HTML), class (TypeScript), and metadata.
*   Component decorator: `@Component({ selector: 'app-root', templateUrl: './app.component.html', styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'] })`.
*   `selector`: The HTML tag used to render the component.
*   `templateUrl`/`template`: Defines the component's HTML.
*   `styleUrls`/`styles`: Defines the component's CSS.

### Creating and Using Components
*   Using the Angular CLI to generate components (`ng generate component my-component`).
*   Registering components in modules.
*   Using components within other components.

### Data Binding
*   Understanding different types of data binding:
    *   Interpolation: `{{ myProperty }}`.
    *   Property binding: `[src]="myProperty"`.
    *   Event binding: `(click)="myMethod()"`.
    *   Two-way binding: `[(ngModel)]="myProperty"`.

## Modules

### Understanding Angular Modules
*   What are Angular modules and why are they used?
*   The root module (`AppModule`).

### Creating and Importing Modules
*   Generating modules using the Angular CLI (`ng generate module my-module`).
*   Importing modules into other modules using the `imports` array.

### Feature Modules
*   Organizing application features into separate modules.
*   Lazy loading modules for improved performance.

## Templates and Directives

### Template Syntax
*   Understanding Angular's template syntax.
*   Using expressions and statements in templates.

### Built-in Directives
*   Structural directives: `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`.
*   Attribute directives: `NgStyle`, `NgClass`.

### Creating Custom Directives
*   Generating custom directives using the Angular CLI (`ng generate directive my-directive`).
*   Implementing custom structural and attribute directives.

# III. Services and Dependency Injection

## Understanding Services
*   What are services and why are they used?
*   Creating reusable logic and data access.

## Dependency Injection (DI)
*   Understanding DI principles.
*   Using the `@Injectable()` decorator.
*   Injecting services into components and other services.

## Creating and Using Services
*   Generating services using the Angular CLI (`ng generate service my-service`).
*   Registering services with modules (`providers` array).
*   Consuming services in components.

# IV. Routing and Navigation

## Setting Up Routing
*   Importing the `RouterModule` in your `AppModule`.
*   Configuring routes using the `Routes` array.

## Defining Routes
*   Defining routes for different components.
*   Using route parameters.
*   Wildcard routes for handling 404 errors.

## Navigation
*   Using the `<router-outlet>` directive to display routed components.
*   Using the `routerLink` directive for navigation.
*   Programmatic navigation using the `Router` service.

# V. Forms

## Template-Driven Forms
*   Importing the `FormsModule` in your `AppModule`.
*   Using `ngModel` for two-way binding.
*   Validating form inputs using built-in validators.

## Reactive Forms
*   Importing the `ReactiveFormsModule` in your `AppModule`.
*   Creating `FormGroup` and `FormControl` instances.
*   Using `Validators` for form validation.
*   Synchronous and asynchronous validation.
*   Displaying validation errors.

## Custom Form Validators
*   Creating custom validator functions.
*   Registering custom validators with form controls.

# VI. HTTP Communication

## Making HTTP Requests
*   Importing the `HttpClientModule` in your `AppModule`.
*   Injecting the `HttpClient` service.
*   Making GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
*   Handling responses and errors.

## Working with Observables
*   Understanding Observables and their role in HTTP communication.
*   Subscribing to Observables.
*   Using RxJS operators to transform and filter data.

## Interceptors
*   Creating HTTP interceptors.
*   Adding headers to requests.
*   Handling authentication tokens.
*   Logging requests and responses.

# VII. State Management

## Introduction to State Management
*   Understanding the need for state management in complex applications.
*   Overview of different state management libraries (e.g., NgRx, Akita).

## NgRx (Optional)
*   Setting up NgRx in your application.
*   Defining actions, reducers, and selectors.
*   Using the `Store` service to dispatch actions and select state.

# VIII. Testing

## Unit Testing
*   Setting up a testing environment.
*   Writing unit tests for components, services, and directives.
*   Using tools like Jasmine and Karma.

## End-to-End Testing
*   Writing end-to-end tests to verify application behavior.
*   Using tools like Protractor or Cypress.

# IX. Deployment

## Building for Production
*   Using the Angular CLI to build your application for production (`ng build --prod`).
*   Understanding the build output and optimization techniques.

## Deployment Options
*   Deploying to platforms like Netlify, Vercel, Firebase Hosting, or AWS.
*   Configuring your server for SPA routing.

# X. Advanced Topics

## Angular Universal (Server-Side Rendering)
*   Understanding the benefits of server-side rendering.
*   Setting up Angular Universal.
*   Configuring your application for server-side rendering.

## Web Components with Angular Elements
*   Creating custom HTML elements using Angular.
*   Packaging Angular components as Web Components.
*   Using Web Components in other frameworks or plain HTML.

## Performance Optimization
*   Techniques for optimizing Angular application performance.
*   Lazy loading modules and components.
*   Using change detection strategies.
*   Optimizing images and assets.
