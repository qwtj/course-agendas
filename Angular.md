*   **Example Prompt:** "Provide an example using `*ngFor` to render a list (`<ul><li>`) from an array of strings in the component."

### `*ngSwitch`
"Explain `*ngSwitch`, `*ngSwitchCase`, and `*ngSwitchDefault` for conditionally displaying one element from a set of possibilities, similar to a JavaScript `switch` statement."
*   **Example Prompt:** "Show an example using `*ngSwitch` to display different content based on a component property's value (e.g., 'admin', 'user', 'guest')."

## Attribute Directives
"Explain that Attribute Directives change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive. Focus on built-in directives `ngClass` and `ngStyle`."

"Define Angular Pipes as simple functions used within templates to transform data before displaying it (e.g., formatting dates, currency, strings)."

### Using Built-in Pipes
"Demonstrate how to use common built-in pipes like `DatePipe`, `UpperCasePipe`, `LowerCasePipe`, `CurrencyPipe`, and `DecimalPipe` using the `|` syntax in templates."
*   **Example Prompt:** "Show examples of using the `DatePipe` (`{{ today | date:'shortDate' }}`) and `CurrencyPipe` (`{{ amount | currency:'USD' }}`) in interpolation."

### Parameterizing Pipes
"Explain how to pass parameters to pipes to customize their behavior (e.g., `{{ today | date:'yyyy-MM-dd' }}`)."

# VII. Forms in Angular

## Introduction to Angular Forms
"Explain the two approaches Angular provides for handling user input through forms: Template-Driven Forms and Reactive Forms. Briefly describe the key difference (logic in template vs. logic in component class)."

## Template-Driven Forms
"Describe Template-Driven Forms, where form logic (like validation rules and data binding) is primarily defined within the template using directives like `ngModel` and validation attributes."

### Setting Up (`FormsModule`)
"Explain that Template-Driven Forms require importing `FormsModule` into the relevant `NgModule`."

### Using `ngModel` and `name` attribute

### Basic Validation
"Show how to use standard HTML5 validation attributes (like `required`, `minlength`) within the template and how Angular binds to them. Explain how to access form and control states (e.g., `valid`, `invalid`, `touched`, `dirty`) using template reference variables to show validation messages."
*   **Example Prompt:** "Extend the login form example to include the `required` attribute and conditionally display error messages based on `usernameInput.valid` and `usernameInput.touched` (where `#usernameInput="ngModel"`)."

## Reactive Forms
"Describe Reactive Forms, where the form structure, data model, and validation rules are explicitly defined and managed in the component's TypeScript class using `FormControl`, `FormGroup`, and `FormArray`."

### Setting Up (`ReactiveFormsModule`)
"Explain that Reactive Forms require importing `ReactiveFormsModule` into the relevant `NgModule`."

"Explain the core classes: `FormControl` (for individual controls), `FormGroup` (for collections of controls), and the `FormBuilder` service (a convenient way to create form instances)."
*   **Example Prompt:** "Show how to create a simple reactive login form model in the component using `FormBuilder`: `this.loginForm = this.fb.group({ username: ['', Validators.required], password: [''] });`."

### Binding in the Template (`formGroup`, `formControlName`)
"Demonstrate how to connect the reactive form model created in the component to the HTML template using the `[formGroup]` directive on the `<form>` element and `formControlName` directive on individual input elements."
*   **Example Prompt:** "Show the template counterpart for the reactive login form, using `[formGroup]="loginForm"` and `formControlName="username"`."

### Handling Submission and Validation
"Show how to handle form submission using a standard button click handler in the component and accessing form values via `this.loginForm.value`.

*   **Key Point:** Explain that `HttpClient` methods return RxJS Observables.

### Handling Responses with Observables (RxJS)
"Introduce RxJS Observables as the mechanism used by `HttpClient` to handle asynchronous responses. Show the basic pattern of subscribing (`.subscribe()`) to an Observable returned by an HTTP method to receive the data or handle errors."
*   **Example Prompt:** "Provide an example of a service method using `this.http.get<User[]>('/api/users')` and a component subscribing to it: `this.userService.getUsers().subscribe(users => this.users = users, error => console.error(error));`."

## Introduction to State Management
"Explain the concept of state management in front-end applications, especially as applications grow in complexity. Discuss the challenges of managing shared state across multiple components (e.g., user authentication status, fetched data)."

### Simple State Management with Services
"Describe how basic state management can be achieved using RxJS Subjects (like `BehaviorSubject`) within services to hold state and allow components to subscribe to changes."
*   **Example Prompt:** "Show a simple example of an `AuthService` using a `BehaviorSubject` to store the current user's login status and providing an Observable for components to subscribe to."

"Introduce Jasmine as the default testing framework for Angular (providing functions like `describe`, `it`, `expect`) and Karma as the default test runner (executing tests in a browser environment)."

## Unit Testing
"Define Unit Tests as tests focusing on isolating and verifying the logic of individual units (classes, methods) like components, services, or pipes, often using mocks or stubs for dependencies."

### Testing Components
"Describe how to unit test a component's class logic. Show how to create an instance of the component class, interact with its methods/properties, and make assertions using `expect`."
*   **Key Point:** Explain the role of `TestBed.configureTestingModule` for setting up a testing module environment and handling component dependencies (like services) using mock implementations or Angular's DI.
*   **Example Prompt:** "Provide a simple example of a unit test for a component method that updates a property, using `TestBed` and `expect`."

### Testing Pipes
"Explain how to unit test a custom pipe by creating an instance and calling its `transform` method with various inputs."

## Integration Testing
"Define Integration Tests in the Angular context as tests that verify the interaction between a component's class and its template, checking rendering, data binding, and event handling without isolating the template."
*   **Key Point:** Explain that component integration tests also use `TestBed` but focus more on interacting with the DOM via `ComponentFixture` and `DebugElement`.
*   **Example Prompt:** "Provide an example of an integration test that checks if a component property is correctly displayed in the template via interpolation after fixture creation and change detection (`fixture.detectChanges()`)."

## End-to-End (E2E) Testing
"Define End-to-End (E2E) tests as tests that simulate real user interactions with the complete application running in a browser, verifying application workflows from start to finish."

### E2E Testing Tools: Protractor (Legacy) / Cypress / Playwright
"Mention Protractor as the historical E2E testing tool for Angular (now deprecated) and introduce modern alternatives like Cypress or Playwright."
*   **Note:** Focus conceptually on E2E testing rather than deep dives into specific tool syntax unless requested.
*   **Example Prompt:** "Describe a conceptual E2E test scenario for a login feature: navigate to the login page, find username/password inputs, fill them, click the submit button, and assert that the user is redirected to the dashboard."

*   ### Combination Operators (`combineLatest`, `forkJoin`)
    "Explain `combineLatest` (emit when any observable emits, combining latest values) and `forkJoin` (emit when all observables complete, combining last values)."
*   ### Flattening Operators (`switchMap`, `mergeMap`, `concatMap`)
    "Briefly explain the use case for flattening operators like `switchMap` (e.g., for dependent HTTP requests where previous requests should be cancelled)."
*   **Further Exploration Link Prompt:** "Provide a link to the RxJS documentation or a relevant learning resource."

## Content Projection (`<ng-content>`)
"Explain Content Projection using the `<ng-content>` element as a way to create reusable components that can accept and display content provided from the parent component template."

*   ### Bundle Analysis
    "Mention tools like `webpack-bundle-analyzer` (can be integrated with Angular CLI) to inspect the size of JavaScript bundles and identify areas for optimization."

## Advanced Error Handling (`ErrorHandler`)
"Introduce Angular's global `ErrorHandler` class as a way to intercept and handle uncaught exceptions application-wide, useful for centralized logging or user notification."
