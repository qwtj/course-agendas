Saw Templars as an obstacle to centralized royal power. [13]
### Accusations and Arrests #Heresy #Blasphemy #Immorality
Accusations surfaced as early as 1304/1305. [2]
Specific charges included heresy, idolatry (worship of a head - Baphomet?), blasphemy (denying Christ, spitting on the cross), obscene initiation rituals (kissing), sodomy. [2, 13, 15]
Charges likely baseless, calculated to incite fear, similar to those used against Pope Boniface VIII. [2]

Templar property sequestered in France. [2]

Likelihood of confession depended on whether torture was used. [3]

Council of Vienne (1311-1312): Voted against suppression initially, but Philip pressured Clement V. [2, 15]
Pope Clement V suppressed the Order via papal bull *Vox in excelso* (March 22, 1312), citing scandal rather than proven guilt. [1, 2, 15]
### Chinon Parchment #PapalInvestigation #HeresyAbsolution
Document discovered in Vatican Archives (2001) shows Pope Clement V initially absolved Templar leaders of heresy in 1308 after investigation at Chinon, finding only lesser infractions. [15, 16, 19]

### Fate of Templars and Assets #Executions #TransferOfProperty
Jacques de Molay and Geoffroi de Charney burned at the stake in Paris (1314) after retracting confessions. [2, 4, 19]
