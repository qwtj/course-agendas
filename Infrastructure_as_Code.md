# I. Introduction to Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Understanding IaC Principles

### Defining Infrastructure as Code

*   Treating infrastructure configuration as code.
*   Applying software development practices to infrastructure management.

### Benefits of IaC

*   Automation and repeatability.
*   Version control and collaboration.
*   Reduced errors and increased consistency.
*   Faster deployment and scaling.

## IaC Tools and Technologies

### Overview of popular IaC tools

*   Terraform
*   Ansible
*   AWS CloudFormation
*   Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
*   Pulumi

### Choosing the right tool for the job

*   Considering project requirements.
*   Evaluating tool features and ecosystem.
*   Assessing team expertise and existing infrastructure.

# II. Terraform Fundamentals

## Terraform Configuration Language (HCL)

### Syntax and Structure

*   Blocks, arguments, and attributes.
*   Data types: strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and maps.
*   Example: Defining a resource in HCL.

    ```terraform
    resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      ami           = "ami-0c55b932c8b723716"
      instance_type = "t2.micro"
    }
    ```

### Variables and Outputs

*   Declaring input variables.
*   Defining output values.
*   Using variables and outputs to parameterize configurations.

### Providers

*   Configuring providers for different infrastructure platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
*   Authentication and authorization.

## Terraform Workflow

### `terraform init`

*   Initializing a Terraform working directory.
*   Downloading provider plugins.

### `terraform plan`

*   Creating an execution plan.
*   Reviewing the changes Terraform will make.

### `terraform apply`

*   Applying the changes defined in the plan.
*   Creating, updating, or deleting resources.

### `terraform destroy`

*   Destroying all resources managed by Terraform.

## State Management

### Understanding Terraform State

*   Storing infrastructure state in a file.
*   Importance of state management for tracking resources.

### Remote State Storage

*   Configuring remote state backends (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
*   Benefits of using remote state: collaboration, versioning, and security.
*   Example: Configuring S3 as a remote backend.

    ```terraform
    terraform {
      backend "s3" {
        bucket = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
        key    = "terraform.tfstate"
        region = "us-west-2"
      }
    }
    ```

# III. Advanced Terraform Concepts

## Modules

### Creating and Using Modules

*   Encapsulating reusable infrastructure components.
*   Defining module inputs and outputs.
*   Example: Creating a module for deploying a web server.

### Module Composition

*   Combining multiple modules to create complex infrastructure.
*   Managing module dependencies.

## Data Sources

### Querying Existing Infrastructure

*   Using data sources to fetch information about existing resources.
*   Example: Using a data source to get the ID of a VPC.

    ```terraform
    data "aws_vpc" "default" {
      default = true
    }

    output "vpc_id" {
      value = data.aws_vpc.default.id
    }
    ```

### Dynamic Configuration

*   Using data sources to dynamically configure resources based on existing infrastructure.

## Provisioners

### When and How to Use Provisioners

*   Executing scripts or commands on resources after creation.
*   Use cases: software installation, configuration management.
*   Types of provisioners: `remote-exec`, `local-exec`, `file`.
*   Example: Installing Nginx on an EC2 instance using `remote-exec`.

    ```terraform
    resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      ami           = "ami-0c55b932c8b723716"
      instance_type = "t2.micro"

      provisioner "remote-exec" {
        inline = [
          "sudo apt update",
          "sudo apt install -y nginx",
        ]

        connection {
          type        = "ssh"
          user        = "ubuntu"
          private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
          host        = self.public_ip
        }
      }
    }
    ```

### Best Practices for Provisioners

*   Minimizing the use of provisioners.
*   Using configuration management tools instead of provisioners whenever possible.

      tasks:
        - name: Install Apache
          apt:
            name: apache2
            state: present
        - name: Start Apache
