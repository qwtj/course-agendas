## Core Concepts #Fundamentals #Basics #PyTorchAPI
Fundamental building blocks and principles of PyTorch.

### Tensors #DataStructure #Arrays
The central data structure in PyTorch, similar to NumPy arrays but with GPU acceleration capabilities.
Think of tensors as multi-dimensional arrays used for storing and manipulating data.
#### Tensor Creation #Initialization #Generation
Different ways to create tensors (e.g., `torch.tensor()`, `torch.zeros()`, `torch.randn()`).
#### Tensor Operations #Manipulation #Math
Mathematical operations (addition, multiplication), indexing, slicing, reshaping (`.view()`, `.reshape()`), and broadcasting.
#### NumPy Bridge #Integration #Compatibility
Seamless conversion between PyTorch Tensors and NumPy arrays (`.numpy()`, `torch.from_numpy()`).
#### GPU Acceleration #CUDA #Performance
Moving tensors between CPU and GPU using `.to(device)` or `.cuda()`.

### Autograd: Automatic Differentiation #Gradients #Backpropagation
PyTorch's engine for automatically computing gradients, essential for training neural networks.
#### Computation Graph #DAG #Tracking
How PyTorch tracks operations to build a dynamic computation graph.
#### `requires_grad` #Tracking #Parameters
Attribute to signal PyTorch that gradients need to be computed for a tensor.

### Modules (`torch.nn`) #NeuralNetworks #Layers #Models
Building blocks for creating neural networks. Provides layers, loss functions, containers, etc.
#### `nn.Module` #BaseClass #NetworkStructure
The base class for all neural network modules. Models are built by subclassing `nn.Module`. Requires defining `__init__()` (layers) and `forward()` (computation).
#### Common Layers #BuildingBlocks #Architecture
    *   `nn.Linear`: Fully connected layers. #LinearLayer
    *   `nn.Conv1d`, `nn.Conv2d`, `nn.Conv3d`: Convolutional layers for different dimensions. #Convolution #CNN
    *   `nn.RNN`, `nn.LSTM`, `nn.GRU`: Recurrent layers for sequence data. #RNN #LSTM #SequenceModels
    *   `nn.Transformer`: Transformer architecture components. #Transformer #Attention
    *   Pooling Layers (`nn.MaxPool2d`, `nn.AvgPool2d`): Downsampling layers. #Pooling
    *   Normalization Layers (`nn.BatchNorm2d`, `nn.LayerNorm`): Stabilizing training. #Normalization
    *   Dropout Layers (`nn.Dropout`): Regularization technique. #Regularization #Dropout
#### Activation Functions #NonLinearity #Activation
Functions like `nn.ReLU`, `nn.Sigmoid`, `nn.Tanh`, `nn.Softmax`, `F.relu` (functional). Applied after layers to introduce non-linearity.

#### Containers #ModelOrganization #Structure
Ways to group layers: `nn.Sequential`, `nn.ModuleList`, `nn.ModuleDict`.
#### Parameters (`nn.Parameter`) #Weights #Biases #Learnable
A wrapper for Tensors indicating they are learnable model parameters. Automatically registered when assigned as attributes to an `nn.Module`.

### Optimization (`torch.optim`) #Training #ParameterUpdate
Algorithms used to update model parameters based on computed gradients.
#### Optimizer Algorithms #GradientDescent #Learning
Common optimizers like `optim.SGD` (Stochastic Gradient Descent), `optim.Adam`, `optim.RMSprop`, `optim.AdamW`.
#### Learning Rate Scheduling #LRSchedule #TrainingControl
Adjusting the learning rate during training (e.g., `lr_scheduler.StepLR`, `lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau`).

## Data Handling (`torch.utils.data`) #Dataset #DataLoader #InputPipeline

## Model Training Workflow #Pipeline #MLOps #Lifecycle
The standard sequence of steps involved in training a PyTorch model.

### Data Preparation #Input #Preprocessing
Loading and preparing datasets using `Dataset` and `DataLoader`.
### Model Definition #Architecture #Instantiation
Creating an instance of the neural network model (subclass of `nn.Module`).
### Loss Function Selection #Criterion #Objective
Choosing an appropriate loss function from `torch.nn` based on the task.
### Optimizer Selection #Algorithm #ParameterUpdate
Choosing an optimizer from `torch.optim` to update model weights.
### Training Loop #Iteration #Epochs
The core loop iterating over the dataset multiple times (epochs).
#### Forward Pass #Prediction #Computation
Passing input data through the model to get predictions (`output = model(input)`).
#### Loss Calculation #Evaluation #ErrorMetric
Computing the loss between model predictions and actual targets (`loss = criterion(output, target)`).
#### Backward Pass #GradientComputation #Autograd
Computing gradients of the loss with respect to model parameters (`loss.backward()`).
#### Optimizer Step #WeightUpdate #Learning
Updating model parameters using the optimizer (`optimizer.step()`).
#### Zero Gradients #Reset #IterationStart
Clearing previous gradients before the next iteration (`optimizer.zero_grad()`).
### Evaluation Loop #Validation #Testing #Performance
Assessing model performance on a separate dataset (validation or test set) usually with gradients disabled (`torch.no_grad()`).
### Monitoring and Logging #Tracking #ExperimentManagement
Using tools like TensorBoard or Weights & Biases to track loss, metrics, and hyperparameters.

## Saving and Loading Models #Persistence #Checkpointing #Deployment
Methods for saving model state for later use or deployment.

### Saving/Loading `state_dict` #Weights #Recommended
Saving and loading only the learnable parameters (weights and biases). This is the recommended approach for flexibility.
#### Saving #Serialization #Export
`torch.save(model.state_dict(), PATH)`
#### Loading #Deserialization #Import
`model.load_state_dict(torch.load(PATH))`, requires model architecture to be defined first. `model.eval()` is crucial after loading for inference.
### Saving/Loading Entire Model #Pickle #LessFlexible
Saving the entire model object using Python's pickle module. Less recommended as it binds the saved model to specific code structures.
#### Saving #Serialization #CompleteObject
`torch.save(model, PATH)`
#### Loading #Deserialization #CompleteObject
`model = torch.load(PATH)`
### Checkpointing #ResumingTraining #FaultTolerance
Saving the model's `state_dict`, optimizer's `state_dict`, epoch number, loss, etc., to allow resuming training later.

## GPU and Distributed Training #Parallelism #Scaling #Performance
Techniques for accelerating training using GPUs and multiple machines.

### Using GPUs (`.to(device)`) #CUDA #HardwareAcceleration
Moving models and tensors to the GPU for faster computation. `device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")`.
### `torch.nn.DataParallel` (DP) #SingleNode #MultiGPU #Simpler
Wraps a model to enable parallel training on multiple GPUs within a single machine. Simpler setup but can have load balancing issues.
### `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` (DDP) #MultiNode #MultiGPU #RecommendedParallel
The recommended approach for both single-node multi-GPU and multi-node distributed training. More efficient than DP. Requires setup using `torch.distributed`.
### `torch.distributed` Package #Communication #Backend
