# I. Introduction to AWS CDK

## Understanding Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### Benefits of IaC

### IaC tools comparison (CloudFormation, Terraform, CDK)

## Introduction to AWS CDK

### CDK Concepts: Apps, Stacks, Constructs

### Supported Programming Languages (TypeScript, Python, Java, .NET, Go)

### CDK CLI and its commands (e.g., `cdk init`, `cdk synth`, `cdk deploy`, `cdk destroy`)

# II. Setting Up Your CDK Environment

## Installing Node.js and npm

### Downloading and installing Node.js

### Verifying the installation (`node -v`, `npm -v`)

## Installing the AWS CLI and Configuring Credentials

### Installing the AWS CLI (`pip install awscli`)

### Configuring AWS credentials (`aws configure`)

### Understanding AWS regions and availability zones

## Installing the AWS CDK Toolkit

### Installing the CDK CLI (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)

### Verifying the installation (`cdk --version`)

## Initializing a CDK Project

### Creating a new CDK project (`cdk init app --language typescript`)

### Understanding the project structure (lib/, bin/, test/, cdk.json)

# III. CDK Constructs

## Understanding CDK Constructs

### What are Constructs? (Basic building blocks)

### Types of Constructs: L1, L2, L3 (CFN Resources, Higher-Level Constructs, Patterns)

### CDK Libraries and AWS Construct Library

## Working with L1 Constructs (CloudFormation Resources)

### Directly using CloudFormation resources in CDK

### Example: Creating an S3 bucket using `CfnBucket`

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';

export class MyStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new s3.CfnBucket(this, 'MyCfnBucket', {
      bucketName: 'my-cfn-bucket'
    });
  }
}
```

## Working with L2 Constructs (Higher-Level Constructs)

### Using higher-level constructs for common resources

### Example: Creating an S3 bucket using `Bucket`

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';

export class MyStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyBucket', {
      versioned: true,
    });
  }
}
```

## Working with L3 Constructs (Patterns)

### Using pre-built patterns to simplify complex infrastructure setups

### Example: Creating a static website with S3, CloudFront, and Route 53

### Exploring available patterns in the AWS Solutions Constructs library

# IV. Core CDK Concepts

## Stacks

### Defining Stacks: Creating and managing infrastructure units

### Stack Properties: region, account, environment variables

### Deploying multiple stacks

## App

### Defining Apps: The root construct that contains stacks

### Configuring the App

### Synth and Deploy: Orchestrating resource creation

## Properties and Configuration

### Setting properties for constructs

### Using environment variables for configuration

### Utilizing CDK Context for runtime parameters

# V. Deploying Your CDK Application

## Synthesizing CloudFormation Templates

### Using `cdk synth` to generate CloudFormation templates

### Examining the generated template.yaml file

## Deploying to AWS

### Using `cdk deploy` to deploy the application

### Understanding the deployment process

### Troubleshooting deployment errors

## Destroying Resources

### Using `cdk destroy` to remove deployed resources

### Implications of destroying resources

# VI. Working with Common AWS Services

## Creating an S3 Bucket

### Defining an S3 bucket with versioning and access policies

### Uploading files to the S3 bucket

## Creating an EC2 Instance

### Defining an EC2 instance with an AMI and security group

### SSHing into the EC2 instance

## Creating a VPC

### Defining a VPC with subnets and routing tables

### Launching EC2 instances within the VPC

## Defining IAM Roles and Policies

### Creating IAM roles with specific permissions

### Attaching IAM roles to EC2 instances

# VII. Advanced CDK Topics

### Automating deployments with CDK Pipelines

### Defining a pipeline with source, build, and deploy stages

### Integrating with CI/CD systems

## CDK Aspects

### Applying cross-cutting concerns with CDK Aspects

### Implementing security best practices using Aspects

### Validating resource configurations

## Custom Constructs

### Creating reusable custom constructs

### Publishing and sharing custom constructs

## Testing CDK Applications

### Unit testing constructs

### Integration testing deployed infrastructure

# VIII. CDK Best Practices

## Organizing CDK Projects

### Structuring your project for maintainability

### Using modules and packages

## Handling Secrets

### Securely managing secrets in CDK applications

### Integrating with AWS Secrets Manager
