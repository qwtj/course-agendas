### Hue #Hue #ColorName #Identity
The pure color itself (e.g., red, blue, green). Position on the color wheel.

### Saturation (Chroma) #Saturation #Intensity #Purity
The intensity or purity of a hue. High saturation means vivid, low saturation means dull/grayish.

### Value (Brightness/Luminance) #Value #Brightness #Lightness #Luminance
The relative lightness or darkness of a color.

Mixing a hue with gray.

## Color Harmony and Schemes #Relationships #Aesthetics #Composition
Principles for creating visually pleasing color combinations.

### Definition of Harmony #Balance #Unity #Aesthetics

### Basic Color Schemes #Formulas #Combinations

#### Complementary Colors #Complementary #Opposites #HighContrast
Colors directly opposite each other on the wheel.
#### Analogous Colors #Analogous #Adjacent #LowContrast
Colors adjacent to each other on the wheel.
#### Triadic Colors #Triadic #Equidistant #Vibrant

#### Tetradic Colors (Rectangle/Square) #Tetradic #FourColors #Complex
Four colors arranged into two complementary pairs.
#### Split-Complementary #SplitComplementary #Variation #ContrastBalance
A base color plus the two colors adjacent to its complement.
#### Monochromatic #Monochromatic #SingleHue #Variations
Using variations in saturation and value of a single hue.
#### Achromatic #Achromatic #Neutrals #NoHue
Using only neutral colors (black, white, gray).

### Factors Influencing Harmony #Context #Proportion #Culture

## Color Psychology and Symbolism #Meaning #Emotion #Culture
The study of how colors affect human behavior and emotions, and their cultural associations.

### Emotional Responses to Color #Psychology #Affect #Mood
How different colors can evoke feelings (e.g., red = passion, blue = calm).
#### Warm Colors (Reds, Oranges, Yellows) #WarmColors #Energy #Action
#### Cool Colors (Blues, Greens, Violets) #CoolColors #Calm #Serenity
#### Neutral Colors (Black, White, Gray, Brown) #NeutralColors #Balance #Support
