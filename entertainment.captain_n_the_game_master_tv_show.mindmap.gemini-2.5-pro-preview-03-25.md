## Comparison to Source Material #Accuracy #AdaptationChoices #CreativeLiberties
How the show adapted the video games it featured.

### Character Design Changes #Visuals #Inaccuracies
*   **Mega Man:** Green armor instead of blue, shorter stature, sometimes missing arm cannon.
*   **Simon Belmont:** Blond hair, athletic build, often portrayed as vain and cowardly, differing significantly from game appearances.
*   **Kid Icarus (Pit):** Referred to as Kid Icarus, added verbal tic "-icus".
*   **King Hippo:** Blue skin instead of normal flesh tone.
*   **Mother Brain:** Given a distinct face and personality beyond the game's depiction.

### Personality & Lore Changes #Characterization #Storytelling
Characters often given exaggerated personalities (Simon's vanity, Mega Man's speech pattern) not present in the games. Lore sometimes simplified or altered for the show's narrative needs. Writers reportedly had limited access to game materials beyond cartridges, leading to interpretations based heavily on assumption or limited information.

### World Integration #LevelDesign #SettingAdaptation
Game worlds were adapted into distinct regions within Videoland, sometimes combining elements loosely or focusing on specific themes (e.g., Kongoland, Megaland, Hyrule). Some worlds were visited without their main protagonists appearing (e.g., *Wizards & Warriors*).
