# Reinforcement Learning #Overview #MachineLearning
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an area of machine learning where an agent learns optimal behavior by interacting with an environment through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions. Unlike supervised learning, it doesn't require labeled data; unlike unsupervised learning, its goal is to maximize a cumulative reward signal rather than find hidden structure.

## Fundamentals and Key Concepts #Basics #Theory #CoreComponents
Introduces the basic elements and terminology of RL problems.
### Agent #Learner #DecisionMaker
The entity that learns and makes decisions.
### Environment #World #System
The external system the agent interacts with. It responds to the agent's actions and presents new situations (states) to the agent.
### State (S) #Situation #Observation
A representation of the current situation or configuration of the environment as perceived by the agent.
### Action (A) #Choice #Decision
A move or decision made by the agent from the set of available options in a given state.
### Reward (R) #Feedback #Signal
A scalar value received by the agent from the environment after taking an action in a state. It indicates the immediate desirability of the action taken in that state.
### Policy (π) #Strategy #Behavior
The agent's strategy or rule used to select actions based on the current state. It maps states to actions.
### Value Function (V, Q) #ExpectedReturn #Utility
Estimates the long-term desirability of states (State-Value function, V) or state-action pairs (Action-Value function, Q). Represents the expected cumulative future reward.
### Model (Optional) #EnvironmentDynamics #PredictiveElement
The agent's representation of the environment's dynamics. It predicts state transitions and rewards. RL methods can be model-based or model-free.
### Episode #Trial #Trajectory
A sequence of states, actions, and rewards from a starting state to a terminal state.

## Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) #Formalism #Framework #Mathematics
The mathematical framework used to model sequential decision-making problems in RL.
### Formal Definition #Tuple #Components
Defined by a tuple (S, A, P, R, γ).
#### State Space (S) #SetOfStates #EnvironmentConfigurations
The set of all possible states the agent can be in.
#### Action Space (A) #SetOfActions #AgentChoices
The set of all possible actions the agent can take.
#### Transition Probability Function (P) #Dynamics #StateChanges
P(s' | s, a): Probability of transitioning to state s' from state s after taking action a.
#### Reward Function (R) #FeedbackMechanism #GoalDefinition
R(s, a, s'): The immediate reward received after transitioning from state s to s' via action a. Sometimes defined as R(s, a) or R(s).
#### Discount Factor (γ) #FutureRewardImportance #Gamma
A value between 0 and 1 that determines the present value of future rewards. γ close to 0 emphasizes immediate rewards, while γ close to 1 values future rewards highly.
### Bellman Equations #Recursion #ValueIteration
Fundamental equations that define the relationship between the value of a state (or state-action pair) and the values of successor states. Used for calculating value functions.
#### Bellman Expectation Equation #PolicyEvaluation #ValuePrediction
Defines the value function for a given policy π.
#### Bellman Optimality Equation #OptimalPolicy #ValueOptimization
Defines the optimal value function, independent of any specific policy. Solving this yields the best possible performance.

## Exploration vs. Exploitation #Dilemma #LearningStrategy #Balance
The fundamental trade-off in RL where the agent must choose between exploring the environment to discover potentially better actions versus exploiting its current knowledge to maximize immediate rewards.
### Exploration Strategies #Discovery #InformationGathering
Techniques used to encourage visiting less-known states and actions.
#### Epsilon-Greedy #SimpleMethod #RandomAction
With probability ε, choose a random action; otherwise, choose the best-known action.
#### Optimistic Initialization #Encouragement #InitialValues
Initialize value estimates high to encourage exploration of states/actions whose true value hasn't been determined.
#### Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) #Bandits #ConfidenceIntervals
Select actions based on both their estimated value and the uncertainty in that estimate.
#### Boltzmann Exploration (Softmax) #ProbabilityMatching #Temperature
Select actions probabilistically based on their estimated values, often using a temperature parameter to control randomness.
### Exploitation #KnowledgeUse #RewardMaximization
Leveraging the current best-known policy to maximize expected rewards based on past experience.

## Planning and Model-Based RL #Simulation #ModelLearning #Prediction
Methods that rely on having or learning a model of the environment (transition probabilities and rewards) to find an optimal policy.
### Dynamic Programming (DP) #ModelRequired #ExactMethods

#### Value Iteration #OptimalValue #ControlProblem

### Model Learning #SystemIdentification #ModelEstimation

### Simulation-Based Search #Lookahead #TreeSearch
Using the model to simulate future trajectories and make decisions based on lookahead search.
