# The Dead Sea Scrolls #Overview #Archaeology #Judaism #Christianity
An overview of the ancient Jewish manuscripts discovered in the Qumran Caves near the Dead Sea.

## Discovery and Excavation #Discovery #Archaeology #History
The story of how the scrolls were found and the subsequent archaeological work.

### Initial Discovery (1946/47) #Bedouin #Cave1 #JudeanDesert
Accidental finding by Bedouin shepherds (Muhammed edh-Dhib) in Cave 1 near Khirbet Qumran.

### Subsequent Cave Discoveries (1949-1956) #QumranCaves #Archaeologists
Systematic and clandestine searches leading to the discovery of scrolls and fragments in 10 additional caves (Caves 2-11). Cave 12 discovered much later (2017), but looted in antiquity.

### Key Figures #Archaeologists #Team
Roland de Vaux (Director of École Biblique et Archéologique Française, led initial excavations), Gerald Lankester Harding, Early International Team members.

### Archaeological Excavations at Khirbet Qumran #Settlement #QumranSite #Archaeology
