# MAC vs DAC #AccessControl #Comparison #SecurityModels
A comparative overview of Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and Discretionary Access Control (DAC) models used in computer security.

## Introduction to Access Control #Fundamentals #Security #Concepts
Provides foundational knowledge about access control mechanisms and their importance in information security.
Basic principles of restricting access to resources based on identity and authorization.

### What is Access Control? #Definition #Purpose
Defining the concept of controlling who can access what resources (files, systems, data) and what actions they can perform (read, write, execute).

### Why is Access Control Necessary? #Importance #RiskManagement #Compliance
Explaining the need for access control to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad), prevent unauthorized access, and meet regulatory requirements.

### Key Components of Access Control #Entities #Policies #Mechanisms
    *   Subjects (Users, Processes)
    *   Objects (Files, Databases, Devices)
    *   Access Rights/Permissions (Read, Write, Execute)
    *   Access Control Policies
    *   Reference Monitor (Conceptual enforcement mechanism)

## Discretionary Access Control (DAC) Explained #DAC #UserCentric #Flexibility
Detailed exploration of the DAC model, where access control is determined by the owner of the resource.

### Core Principles of DAC #Ownership #Discretion #Permissions
Focuses on the concept that the owner of an object has the discretion to grant or deny access permissions to other subjects.

### How DAC Works #Mechanism #ACLs #Permissions
    *   Ownership Concept: Creator/owner controls access.
    *   Access Control Lists (ACLs): Lists specifying which users/groups have what permissions for an object. #ACL
    *   Permission Bits (Unix/Linux): Read, Write, Execute permissions for Owner, Group, Others. #UnixPermissions
    *   Capability Lists: Subject-focused list of objects and permitted operations (less common).

### Characteristics of DAC #Features #Traits
    *   Flexibility: Easy to grant and modify permissions.
    *   Decentralized Administration: Owners manage their own resources.
    *   Simplicity: Relatively easy to understand and implement for basic scenarios.
    *   Potential for Permission Creep: Over time, users might accumulate unnecessary permissions.
    *   Vulnerability to Trojan Horses: Malicious software running under a user's identity inherits their permissions. #SecurityRisk

### Common DAC Implementations #Examples #OperatingSystems
    *   Standard Unix/Linux file permissions.
    *   Windows NTFS permissions (ACLs).
    *   Most consumer operating systems and file-sharing platforms primarily use DAC.

## Mandatory Access Control (MAC) Explained #MAC #SystemCentric #SecurityLabels
Detailed exploration of the MAC model, where access control policy is centrally controlled by a security administrator/policy, overriding user discretion.

### Core Principles of MAC #Labels #Clearance #PolicyDriven
Focuses on system-wide policies based on classifying subjects (users/processes) and objects (data/resources) with security labels. Access is granted only if the subject's label dominates the object's label according to policy rules.

### How MAC Works #Mechanism #Labels #Rules
    *   Security Labels: Assigning sensitivity levels (e.g., Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, Top Secret) and compartments/categories to subjects and objects. #SensitivityLevels #Compartments
    *   Clearance Levels: Subjects have security clearances.
    *   Formal Models: Mathematical models defining access rules.
        *   Bell-LaPadula Model: Focuses on confidentiality. Rules: No Read Up, No Write Down. #BellLaPadula #Confidentiality
        *   Biba Model: Focuses on integrity. Rules: No Read Down, No Write Up. #BibaModel #Integrity
        *   Clark-Wilson Model: Focuses on integrity through well-formed transactions and separation of duties. #ClarkWilson
    *   Policy Enforcement: The operating system or security kernel enforces the policy based on label comparisons.

### Characteristics of MAC #Features #Traits
    *   Centralized Control: Policy managed by administrators, not resource owners.
    *   High Assurance: Provides stronger security guarantees, especially against insider threats and malware.
    *   Rigidity: Less flexible than DAC; changes require administrative action.
    *   Complexity: Can be complex to configure and manage.
    *   Information Flow Control: Designed to prevent unauthorized flow of information between different security levels. #InformationFlow

### Common MAC Implementations #Examples #OperatingSystems #SecurityEnhanced
    *   SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux): A kernel security module providing MAC capabilities. #SELinux
    *   AppArmor: A Linux security module providing MAC using profiles. #AppArmor
    *   Trusted Solaris: An older version of Solaris with MAC features.
    *   Windows Mandatory Integrity Control (MIC): A MAC-like feature in Windows Vista and later. #WindowsMIC

## Key Differences Summarized #Comparison #DACvsMAC #Contrast
Highlighting the fundamental distinctions between DAC and MAC models.

### Policy Control #Ownership #Administration
    *   DAC: Resource owner controls access policy.
    *   MAC: System-wide security policy enforced; controlled by administrators.

### Flexibility vs. Security #Tradeoffs #Usability
    *   DAC: More flexible, user-friendly, but potentially less secure.
    *   MAC: Less flexible, more complex, but offers higher security assurance.

### Granularity #Permissions #Labels
    *   DAC: Typically controls access based on user/group identity and specific permissions (RWX).
    *   MAC: Controls access based on subject clearance and object sensitivity labels.

### Information Flow Control #DataLeakage #SecurityGoal
    *   DAC: Does not inherently control information flow (e.g., user can copy sensitive data to a less sensitive file).
    *   MAC: Explicitly designed to control information flow based on security levels (e.g., preventing data leakage from high to low).

### Default Access Stance #Permissive #Restrictive
    *   DAC: Often implicitly permissive (if not explicitly denied, access might be allowed, or easily granted).
    *   MAC: Explicitly restrictive (access requires meeting strict policy rules).

### Primary Use Case Focus #GeneralPurpose #HighSecurity
    *   DAC: Suitable for general-purpose computing environments.
    *   MAC: Essential for environments requiring high security and strict data segregation (military, intelligence).
