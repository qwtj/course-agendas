# Software Architecture Patterns #Overview #Concepts
An architectural pattern is a generalized, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software architecture. It provides a blueprint for structuring software systems. [17, 18, 21, 4]

## Introduction to Software Architecture Patterns #Fundamentals #Basics
Defines core concepts, benefits, and distinctions related to software architecture patterns.

### What are Architecture Patterns? #Definition #CoreConcept
Reusable, proven solutions to recurring design problems at the system level, addressing overall structure, component interactions, and quality attributes. [17, 18, 21, 4] They provide a systematic approach to common design challenges. [4] Think of them as blueprints or recipes for designing software systems. [18, 22]

### Why Use Architecture Patterns? #Benefits #Rationale
*   **Improved Quality:** Enhance maintainability, scalability, stability, security, reliability, performance, and other quality attributes. [2, 3, 6, 13]
*   **Increased Productivity:** Reusable solutions save time and effort by avoiding reinvention. [4, 15]
*   **Enhanced Communication:** Provide a common vocabulary for developers and stakeholders. [15, 2]
*   **Better Planning:** Guide development and help anticipate future needs. [2, 17]
*   **Maintainability:** Well-structured patterns often lead to systems that are easier to modify and extend. [3, 15]
*   **Scalability:** Many patterns are designed explicitly to handle growth in users, data, or features. [3, 13]

### Architecture Patterns vs. Design Patterns #Distinction #Comparison
*   **Level of Abstraction:** Architecture patterns operate at a higher system level, defining the overall structure, while design patterns solve specific, lower-level implementation problems within components or subsystems. [12, 18, 21, 24]
*   **Scope:** Architecture patterns affect the entire system or significant subsystems, whereas design patterns typically apply to smaller parts of the codebase (e.g., classes, objects). [18, 25, 30]
*   **Focus:** Architecture patterns deal with structural organization, component responsibilities, and interactions; design patterns focus on refining subsystems, component relationships, and solving specific design issues (like object creation or interaction). [12, 25, 17, 18]

### Architecture Patterns vs. Architectural Styles #Distinction #Comparison
*   **Style:** A high-level structural organization defining component types, interactions, and constraints (e.g., Layered, Microservices, Event-Driven). Represents the coarse-grained system organization. [21, 24]
*   **Pattern:** A reusable solution to a recurring problem within a style or context, often addressing specific quality attributes or interactions (e.g., Circuit Breaker within Microservices). [21, 24]
*   The distinction can sometimes be blurry. [21, 24]

## Common Architecture Patterns Explained #Details #Examples
Detailed breakdown of frequently used patterns.

### Layered (N-Tier) Architecture #Layered #Tiered
Organizes system into horizontal layers (e.g., Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access), each with specific responsibilities. Communication typically restricted between adjacent layers. [2, 3, 4, 6, 13, 14, 18, 22]
#### Pros #Advantages
Modularity, separation of concerns, maintainability, easier standardization. [2, 13]
#### Cons #Disadvantages
Can lead to performance overhead (layers tax), potential for monolithic layers, changes might ripple through layers. [22]

### Client-Server Architecture #ClientServer #Networked
Divides the system into clients (requesting services/resources) and servers (providing services/resources). [2, 3, 4, 13, 18, 24, 30]
#### Pros #Advantages
Centralized control, data management, scalability of server.
#### Cons #Disadvantages
Server can be a single point of failure, potential network bottlenecks.

### Microservices Architecture #Microservices #Distributed
Decomposes an application into a collection of small, independent, loosely coupled services that communicate over a network (often HTTP APIs). [2, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18, 22, 24, 26, 31]
#### Pros #Advantages
Improved scalability (scale services independently), fault isolation, technology diversity, independent deployment, organizational alignment (teams own services). [6, 22]
#### Cons #Disadvantages
Distributed system complexity (transactions, monitoring, testing), network latency, operational overhead, requires mature DevOps practices. [6]

### Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) #Events #Asynchronous
System components communicate via the production, detection, and consumption of events. Promotes loose coupling and responsiveness. [2, 3, 6, 13, 14, 17, 18, 22, 24]
#### Sub-Patterns #Variations
Mediator Topology (Event Broker), Broker Topology (Event Bus). [2]
#### Pros #Advantages
Loose coupling, high scalability, responsiveness, resilience. [14, 22]
#### Cons #Disadvantages
Complexity in tracking event flow, potential for complex debugging, eventual consistency challenges.

### Microkernel (Plugin) Architecture #Core #Plugin
Consists of a minimal core system (microkernel) providing essential functionality, extended via plug-in modules. [2, 3, 13, 14, 24]
#### Pros #Advantages
Extensibility, flexibility, application isolation, dynamic updates. [14]
#### Cons #Disadvantages
Can be complex to design the core system and plugin contracts, potential performance issues depending on plugin interaction.

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) #Services #Integration
Applications are composed of distinct, self-contained services with well-defined interfaces, typically communicating over a network (often using standards like SOAP/WSDL). [2, 13, 14, 17, 24]
#### Pros #Advantages
Service reusability, integration capabilities, business alignment. [13]
#### Cons #Disadvantages
Can become complex to manage services and dependencies, potential for performance bottlenecks with centralized components (like ESB).

#### Pros #Advantages
Simplicity, reusability of filters, parallelism potential.
#### Cons #Disadvantages
Not suitable for interactive systems, potential latency, data transformation overhead.

### Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) #CQRS #Separation
Separates read (query) operations from write (command) operations, often using different data models or even databases. [13, 14]
#### Pros #Advantages
Optimized data models for reads/writes, improved performance and scalability for each path. [14]
#### Cons #Disadvantages
Increased complexity, potential for eventual consistency issues between read/write models.

### Model-View-Controller (MVC) #MVC #UI
Separates application logic into Model (data & business logic), View (UI presentation), and Controller (handles user input, interacts with Model, selects View). [13, 18, 22, 24, 26]
#### Pros #Advantages
Separation of concerns, easier UI modification, improved testability.
#### Cons #Disadvantages
Can become complex in large applications, potential for tight coupling between View and Controller.

## Pattern Selection and Evaluation #DecisionMaking #Tradeoffs
Choosing the appropriate pattern based on system requirements and constraints.

### Identifying Requirements #NeedsAnalysis #Goals
Understanding functional requirements and, critically, non-functional requirements (quality attributes). [2, 6, 26]
### Key Selection Factors #Criteria #Considerations
*   **Project Size and Complexity:** Simple patterns for small projects, more complex ones for larger systems. [3]
*   **Scalability Requirements:** Choose patterns suited for expected growth (e.g., Microservices for high scalability). [3]
*   **Performance Needs:** Select patterns that meet responsiveness targets (e.g., EDA for real-time). [3]
*   **Maintainability & Modifiability:** Consider ease of future changes. [3]
*   **Team Expertise & Resources:** Factor in team familiarity with the pattern. [3]
*   **Budget and Time Constraints:** Some patterns require more upfront investment. [3]
*   **Integration Needs:** How will it connect with existing systems? [3]
*   **Security Requirements:** Pattern implications for security posture. [6]
*   **Availability / Fault Tolerance:** Pattern impact on system resilience. [2, 6]

### Evaluating Trade-offs #ProsCons #Balancing
Every pattern involves trade-offs. There is no single "best" pattern. [22, 25] Evaluating involves balancing competing quality attributes (e.g., performance vs. maintainability). [21]

### Architectural Evaluation Methods #Assessment #Review
Techniques to assess the suitability of a chosen architecture (e.g., ATAM - Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method). [2]

## Relationship with Design Principles #SOLID #GuidingPrinciples
How fundamental design principles inform and are supported by architectural patterns. [9, 27, 28, 30]

### SOLID Principles #OOP #DesignGuidelines
*   **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Often supported by patterns that promote componentization (Microservices, MVC). [28, 30]
*   **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Facilitated by patterns allowing extension without modification (Microkernel/Plugin, Strategy). [28, 30]
*   **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Ensures substitutability, crucial for polymorphic behavior used in many patterns. [28, 30]
*   **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Supported by patterns defining specific interfaces (Microservices APIs, Component-Based). [28, 30]
*   **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Key to decoupling in many patterns (Layered, MVC, Microservices through abstractions). [9, 28, 30]

### Other Principles (DRY, KISS, YAGNI) #BestPractices
*   **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Promoted by reusable components/services in patterns. [27]
*   **Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS):** A general guideline applicable when selecting or implementing patterns.
*   **You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Caution against over-engineering or applying complex patterns prematurely.

## Implementation Considerations #Practicalities #Technology
