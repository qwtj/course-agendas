"<prompt>Rewrite the previous Promise example using `async`/`await` syntax for cleaner asynchronous code flow. Explain the benefits of `async`/`await`.</prompt>"
*   **Example:**
    
```typescript
    // Example using async/await with Deno.readFile
    async function readFileContent(filePath: string) {
      try {
        const data = await Deno.readFile(filePath);
        const decoder = new TextDecoder("utf-8");
        console.log(decoder.decode(data));
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error reading file:", error);
      }
    }
    readFileContent("my_file.txt"); // Requires --allow-read
    ```

    "<prompt>Explain the above code snippet, including the need for `--allow-read` permission.</prompt>"

### Using `fetch`
"<prompt>Provide a practical example of using the global `fetch` function in Deno to make a GET request to a public API and process the JSON response. Remember to mention the required `--allow-net` permission.</prompt>"
*   **Example:**
    
```typescript
    async function fetchData(url: string) {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        }
        const data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
      }
    }
    fetchData("https://api.github.com/users/denoland"); // Requires --allow-net
    ```

    "<prompt>Explain the structure of the fetch example, including error handling and JSON parsing.</prompt>"

*   **Example:**
    
```typescript
    function greet(name: string): string {
      return `Hello, ${name}!`;
    }

    const message: string = greet("Deno Developer");
    console.log(message);
    ```

    "<prompt>Explain how Deno processes the type annotations in the example above during execution.</prompt>"

# VII. Advanced Deno Topics

*   **Learning Objective:** Explore advanced Deno capabilities including interacting with native code (FFI), running WebAssembly, using workers for concurrency, and leveraging Node.js/npm compatibility.

## Foreign Function Interface (FFI)
"<prompt>Explain Deno's unstable Foreign Function Interface (FFI) API (`Deno.dlopen`). Describe its purpose: allowing Deno code to call functions in native dynamic libraries (.so, .dylib, .dll). Mention the security implications and the required `--allow-ffi` permission.</prompt>"

### Basic FFI Example (Conceptual)
"<prompt>Provide a conceptual example of using `Deno.dlopen` to load a simple native library (e.g., a C library with an `add` function) and call a function from it. Highlight the structure: defining the function signature in Deno and calling the symbol. Emphasize the 'unstable' status.</prompt>"
*   **Conceptual Example:**
    
```typescript
    // Assume native library 'libmymath.so'/'mymath.dll' exists with 'int add(int, int)'
    const libraryPath = "./libmymath.so"; // Adjust path and extension per OS

    // Requires --allow-ffi and potentially --unstable flag depending on Deno version
    const dylib = Deno.dlopen(libraryPath, {
      "add": { parameters: ["i32", "i32"], result: "i32" },
    });

    const result = dylib.symbols.add(5, 7); // Call the native function
    console.log("Result from native code:", result); // Output: 12

    dylib.close(); // Close the library handle
    ```

    "<prompt>Explain the conceptual FFI example: loading the library, defining the symbol's signature, calling the native function via `dylib.symbols`, and the necessary permissions/flags (`--allow-ffi`, `--unstable`).</prompt>"

## WebAssembly (Wasm) Integration
"<prompt>Describe Deno's support for running WebAssembly (Wasm) modules. Explain how Wasm allows running code compiled from languages like C++, Rust, Go, etc., within Deno. Show how to load and instantiate a Wasm module using the standard WebAssembly Web APIs (`WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming`, `fetch`).</prompt>"

### Loading and Running Wasm
"<prompt>Provide an example of fetching a Wasm file (`.wasm`) and instantiating it using `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming`. Show how to call an exported function from the Wasm module. Mention necessary permissions (`--allow-net` or `--allow-read` depending on Wasm source).</prompt>"
*   **Example (assuming `add.wasm` exports an `add` function):**
    
```typescript
    // Assuming add.wasm is available locally or via URL
    const wasmUrl = "./add.wasm"; // Or "http://..."

    // Fetch and instantiate the Wasm module
    // Requires --allow-read for local file or --allow-net for URL
    const wasmModule = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch(wasmUrl));

    // Or for local files without fetch:
    // const wasmCode = await Deno.readFile(wasmUrl);
    // const wasmModule = await WebAssembly.instantiate(wasmCode);

    const { add } = wasmModule.instance.exports;

    const result = add(10, 22);
    console.log("Result from Wasm:", result); // Output: 32
    ```

    "<prompt>Explain the Wasm example: fetching/reading the Wasm file, instantiating it, accessing exported functions via `instance.exports`, and calling the Wasm function. Mention required permissions.</prompt>"

## Deno Workers
"<prompt>Explain the concept of Workers in Deno for achieving parallelism/concurrency by running scripts in separate threads. Describe the `Worker` API, how to create a new worker, pass messages using `postMessage`, and receive messages using event listeners (`onmessage`).</prompt>"

### Basic Worker Example
"<prompt>Provide a code example with two files: `main.ts` and `worker.ts`. `main.ts` creates a `Worker` instance from `worker.ts`, sends it a message, and listens for a response. `worker.ts` listens for messages, performs a computation, and sends the result back.</prompt>"
*   **Example `worker.ts`:**
    
```typescript
    // worker.ts
    self.onmessage = (event) => {
      console.log("Worker received:", event.data);
      const result = event.data * 2;
      self.postMessage(result);
    };
    ```

*   **Example `main.ts`:**
    
```typescript
    // main.ts
    const worker = new Worker(new URL("./worker.ts", import.meta.url).href, { type: "module" });

    worker.onmessage = (event) => {
      console.log("Main received result:", event.data);
      // Optionally terminate the worker if done
      // worker.terminate();
    };

    console.log("Main sending message to worker...");
    worker.postMessage(10);
    ```

    "<prompt>Explain the Worker example: how the main script creates the worker using its URL, how messages are sent with `postMessage`, how both scripts use `onmessage` to receive data, and the use of `import.meta.url` for relative path resolution.</prompt>"

## Node.js and npm Compatibility
"<prompt>Describe Deno's increasing compatibility with Node.js built-in modules and npm packages. Explain the use of `npm:` specifiers (e.g., `import express from "npm:express@4";`) to directly import and use packages from the npm registry. Mention the current state and limitations of this compatibility layer.</prompt>"

### Using an npm Package
"<prompt>Show a simple example of importing and using a popular npm package (like `lodash` or `express`) directly within a Deno script using an `npm:` specifier. Include necessary permissions (`--allow-net`, `--allow-read` for dependency installation/caching, potentially `--allow-env`).</prompt>"
*   **Example (using lodash):**
    
```typescript
    // Requires Deno 1.28+ or later for stable npm support
    import _ from "npm:lodash@4"; // Requires --allow-net, --allow-read, --allow-env

    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const shuffled = _.shuffle(numbers);

    console.log("Original:", numbers);
    console.log("Shuffled:", shuffled);
    ```

    "<prompt>Explain the npm compatibility example: the `npm:` specifier syntax, how Deno downloads and manages the npm package, and the permissions required during the first run to download/cache dependencies.</prompt>"

*   **Section Summary:** Deno offers advanced features like FFI for native code, robust Wasm support, Workers for concurrency, and direct compatibility with Node.js/npm modules via `npm:` specifiers.

*   **Quiz:** "<prompt>Generate a 4-question quiz covering the purpose of FFI, how to run Wasm, the use case for Deno Workers, and how to import an npm package.</prompt>"
*   **Transition:** To build robust and efficient applications, understanding performance optimization and benchmarking is crucial. Let's explore these next.
*   **Callout:** **Stability Note:** FFI is still marked as unstable in Deno; its API might change. Node/npm compatibility is rapidly evolving; check Deno release notes for the latest status.
*   **Difficulty:** Advanced
*   **Cross-Reference:** See Section II for Permissions. See Section IX for Debugging complex scenarios involving these features.
*   **Further Reading:** `<prompt>Provide links to the Deno manual sections on FFI, WebAssembly, Workers, and Node/NPM compatibility.</prompt>`
*   **Reflection:** `<prompt>Ask the user to reflect: Which of these advanced features (FFI, Wasm, Workers, npm compatibility) seems most likely to be useful in the types of projects you envision building with Deno, and why?</prompt>`

# VIII. Performance and Optimization

*   **Learning Objective:** Learn techniques for benchmarking, profiling, and optimizing the performance of Deno applications.

## Benchmarking (`Deno.bench`)
"<prompt>Introduce the built-in benchmarking function `Deno.bench`. Explain how it differs from `Deno.test` and its purpose: measuring the performance of code snippets. Show how to define and run benchmark tests.</prompt>"

### Writing Benchmarks
"<prompt>Provide an example of a benchmark file (`my_module.bench.ts`) using `Deno.bench` to compare the performance of two different ways of achieving the same task (e.g., string concatenation methods). Include necessary imports and explain the output format.</prompt>"
*   **Example:**
    
```typescript
    // my_module.bench.ts
    const iterations = 1000;

    // Baseline: Using + operator
    Deno.bench("String Concatenation: + operator", () => {
      let str = "";
      for (let i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
        str += "a";
      }
    });

    // Method 2: Using Array.join
    Deno.bench("String Concatenation: Array.join", () => {
      const arr = [];
      for (let i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
        arr.push("a");
      }
      arr.join("");
    });
    ```

*   "<prompt>Explain how to interpret the output, focusing on metrics like runs/second (higher is better) and average time per iteration (lower is better).</prompt>"
*   "<prompt>Mention that `--allow-` flags might be needed if benchmarks access restricted resources.</prompt>"

## Profiling Deno Applications
"<prompt>Discuss strategies for profiling Deno applications to identify performance bottlenecks. Mention the use of external profiling tools compatible with V8 (like Chrome DevTools or command-line profilers) and how to generate profiling data from Deno.</prompt>"

### Using V8 Inspector/Chrome DevTools
"<prompt>Explain how to run a Deno script with the `--inspect` or `--inspect-brk` flag to enable the V8 inspector protocol. Show how to connect Chrome DevTools to the running Deno process and use the 'Profiler' tab to record CPU profiles.</prompt>"
*   **Command:** `<prompt>Show the command `deno run --inspect-brk my_app.ts` and explain that it starts the inspector and pauses execution until a debugger attaches.</prompt>`
*   "<prompt>Describe the steps to connect Chrome DevTools (by navigating to `chrome://inspect`) and record a CPU profile to identify functions consuming the most execution time.</prompt>"

## Common Optimization Techniques
"<prompt>List and explain common performance optimization techniques relevant to Deno/JavaScript/TypeScript development, such as: minimizing blocking I/O, efficient use of async/await, optimizing loops, choosing appropriate data structures, leveraging Wasm or FFI for CPU-intensive tasks, and reducing unnecessary work.</prompt>"

### Avoiding Blocking I/O
"<prompt>Explain why synchronous I/O operations (less common in Deno's async-first APIs, but possible) can block the event loop and degrade performance. Emphasize using asynchronous APIs (`async`/`await`) for file and network operations.</prompt>"

### Efficient Asynchronous Patterns
"<prompt>Discuss using `Promise.all` or `Promise.allSettled` to run independent asynchronous operations concurrently instead of sequentially with multiple `await` statements.</prompt>"
*   "<prompt>Provide a brief code example comparing sequential `await`s with `Promise.all` for multiple fetch requests.</prompt>"

*   **Section Summary:** Deno provides `Deno.bench` for micro-benchmarking. Profiling can be done using V8 tools like Chrome DevTools via `--inspect`. Optimization involves using async APIs effectively, choosing efficient algorithms, and potentially offloading work to Wasm/FFI.
*   **Glossary:**

    *   `Profiling`: Analyzing code execution to identify performance bottlenecks (CPU usage, memory allocation).
    *   `V8 Inspector`: A debugging and profiling protocol built into the V8 JavaScript engine used by Deno and Chrome.
    *   `Event Loop`: The mechanism in JavaScript runtimes that handles asynchronous operations. Blocking it hinders performance.
*   **Quiz:** "<prompt>Generate a 3-question quiz covering the purpose of `Deno.bench`, how to enable profiling with `--inspect`, and one common optimization technique.</prompt>"
*   **Transition:** Effective development also requires robust error handling and debugging skills, especially for complex issues. Let's focus on that next.
*   **Callout:** **Performance Mindset:** Profile *before* optimizing. Premature optimization can lead to complex, harder-to-maintain code with little actual benefit.
*   **Difficulty:** Advanced
*   **Cross-Reference:** See Section III for Async/Await. See Section VII for Wasm/FFI.
*   **Further Reading:** `<prompt>Provide links to the Deno manual section on Benchmarking and potentially V8/Chrome DevTools profiling guides.</prompt>`
*   **Reflection:** `<prompt>Ask the user to reflect: When developing an application, at what stage would you typically consider running benchmarks or profiling the code?</prompt>`

# IX. Advanced Error Handling and Debugging

*   **Learning Objective:** Develop strategies for robust error management and master techniques for debugging complex scenarios in Deno applications.

## Robust Error Management Strategies
"<prompt>Discuss best practices for error handling in Deno applications. Cover topics like using try...catch blocks effectively, differentiating between operational errors and programmer errors, centralized error handling/logging, and creating custom error types.</prompt>"

### `try...catch` and Error Propagation
"<prompt>Explain the importance of catching specific errors where they can be handled and letting unexpected errors propagate up the call stack to a central handler. Show examples of `try...catch` with specific error checking (`instanceof`).</prompt>"

### Custom Error Types
"<prompt>Demonstrate how to create custom error classes extending the built-in `Error` class to provide more specific error information and facilitate better error handling logic.</prompt>"
*   **Example:**
    
```typescript
    class DatabaseError extends Error {
      constructor(message: string, public query?: string) {
        super(message);
        this.name = "DatabaseError";
      }
    }

    function queryDB() {
      // Simulate error
      const error = true;
      if (error) {
        throw new DatabaseError("Failed to execute query", "SELECT * FROM users");
      }
      // ...
    }

    try {
      queryDB();
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof DatabaseError) {
        console.error(`DB Error: ${error.message}, Query: ${error.query}`);
        // Handle specific DB error (e.g., retry, alert)
      } else {
        console.error("An unexpected error occurred:", error);
        // Handle generic errors
      }
    }
    ```

    "<prompt>Explain the custom `DatabaseError` class and how `instanceof` is used in the `catch` block for specific handling.</prompt>"

### Centralized Logging
"<prompt>Recommend implementing a centralized logging mechanism (potentially using `std/log` or a third-party library) to capture errors and application events consistently. Discuss logging levels (debug, info, warn, error) and structured logging (e.g., JSON format).</prompt>"
*   "<prompt>Provide a brief conceptual example using `std/log` to set up a basic file logger for errors.</prompt>"

## Debugging Complex Scenarios
"<prompt>Explore techniques for debugging challenging issues in Deno, such as race conditions in async code, memory leaks, issues with FFI/Wasm integration, or problems within worker threads.</prompt>"

### Using the Debugger (`--inspect`/`--inspect-brk`)
"<prompt>Reiterate the use of `--inspect`/`--inspect-brk` and a debugger (like Chrome DevTools, VS Code debugger) as the primary tool. Explain setting breakpoints, stepping through code, inspecting variables, and analyzing the call stack, especially for tracing asynchronous operations.</prompt>"

### Debugging Workers
"<prompt>Explain how to debug Deno workers. Mention that each worker typically requires its own inspector instance, often initiated on a different port automatically by Deno, and how to connect the debugger to worker threads.</prompt>"
*   "<prompt>Refer to Deno documentation or provide specific instructions if available on how DevTools lists worker targets for inspection.</prompt>"

### Debugging FFI/Wasm
"<prompt>Discuss challenges in debugging interactions with native code (FFI) or WebAssembly. Suggest strategies like extensive logging on both sides of the boundary (Deno and native/Wasm), using native debugging tools (like GDB/LLDB) for the library itself, and simplifying the interaction points to isolate issues.</prompt>"

### Identifying Memory Leaks
"<prompt>Explain how to use the Memory tab in Chrome DevTools (connected via `--inspect`) to take heap snapshots, compare them over time, and identify objects that are not being garbage collected as expected, potentially indicating memory leaks.</prompt>"

*   **Section Summary:** Robust error handling involves specific catches, custom errors, and centralized logging. Debugging complex Deno issues leverages the V8 inspector (`--inspect`), specialized techniques for workers and FFI/Wasm, and memory profiling tools.
*   **Glossary:**
    *   `Operational Error`: Runtime errors expected during operation (e.g., network unavailable, file not found). Often recoverable.
    *   `Programmer Error`: Bugs in the code (e.g., type error, logic flaw). Usually require code changes.
    *   `Race Condition`: A bug where the outcome depends on the unpredictable timing of concurrent operations.
    *   `Memory Leak`: A bug where memory is allocated but not released when no longer needed, eventually exhausting resources.
    *   `Heap Snapshot`: A record of all objects in the JavaScript heap memory at a specific point in time.
*   **Quiz:** "<prompt>Generate a 4-question quiz covering custom error types, the use of `--inspect-brk`, a strategy for debugging workers, and how to investigate memory leaks.</prompt>"
*   **Transition:** Finally, let's look at the broader Deno ecosystem, community resources, and the future direction of the runtime.
*   **Callout:** **Debugging Tip:** Use `console.log` strategically, but rely on the interactive debugger (`--inspect`) for complex issues, as it provides much more context.
*   **Difficulty:** Advanced
*   **Cross-Reference:** See Section VII for Workers, FFI, Wasm. See Section VIII for Profiling introduction.
*   **Further Reading:** `<prompt>Provide links to the Deno manual section on Debugging, the `std/log` module documentation, and guides on using Chrome DevTools for Node.js/Deno debugging.</prompt>`
