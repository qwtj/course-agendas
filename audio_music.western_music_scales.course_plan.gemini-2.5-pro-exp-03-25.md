Provide the method for finding the relative minor of any Major key (down a minor third, or find the 6th degree) and vice-versa. Give examples like C Major / A Minor, G Major / E Minor.</prompt>"
    *   (Cross-reference: See Section I.A.2 for Minor Third interval)

### 2. Constructing Natural Minor Scales
*   "<prompt>Guide the user through constructing two different Natural Minor scales (e.g., E Natural Minor, C Natural Minor) using the W-H-W-W-H-W-W formula or by relating them to their relative Major keys.</prompt>"

### 1. Identifying the Raised 7th
*   "<prompt>Explain the harmonic function of raising the 7th degree in the Harmonic Minor scale (to create a stronger leading tone pull to the tonic, similar to the Major scale's leading tone). Provide examples showing the Natural Minor 7th versus the Harmonic Minor's raised 7th.</prompt>"
    *   Example: A Natural Minor has G; A Harmonic Minor has G#.

### 2. Constructing Harmonic Minor Scales
*   "<prompt>Guide the user through constructing two different Harmonic Minor scales (e.g., E Harmonic Minor, C Harmonic Minor) by starting with the Natural Minor and raising the 7th degree.</prompt>"
    *   Example: E Harmonic Minor: E-F#-G-A-B-C-D#-E (D is raised to D#)

## C. Melodic Minor Scale
"<prompt>Explain the purpose and construction of the Melodic Minor scale. Describe its unique characteristic: it uses different notes when ascending versus descending. Explain the ascending form (Natural Minor with raised 6th and 7th degrees: W-H-W-W-W-W-H) and the descending form (identical to the Natural Minor scale: W-W-H-W-W-H-W). Construct A Melodic Minor (ascending and descending).</prompt>"

### 1. Rationale for Melodic Minor
*   "<prompt>Explain *why* the Melodic Minor scale exists: the ascending form raises the 6th and 7th degrees to create a smoother melodic line towards the tonic (avoiding the augmented second of the Harmonic Minor), while the descending form reverts to the Natural Minor for a gentler sound moving away from the tonic.</prompt>"

### 2. Constructing Melodic Minor Scales
*   "<prompt>Guide the user through constructing the ascending and descending forms of two different Melodic Minor scales (e.g., E Melodic Minor, C Melodic Minor).</prompt>"
    *   Example: C Melodic Minor Ascending: C-D-Eb-F-G-A-B-C
    *   Example: C Melodic Minor Descending: C-Bb-Ab-G-F-Eb-D-C
        "<prompt>Show the step-by-step construction of the G Melodic Minor scale (ascending and descending forms).</prompt>"

> **Key Point:** The three minor scales offer distinct flavors. Natural Minor is related directly to Major keys, Harmonic Minor provides a strong dominant function, and Melodic Minor smooths out melodic lines.

*   **Quiz:**
    "<prompt>Create a 5-question quiz testing the ability to: identify the type of minor scale (Natural, Harmonic, Melodic) from a given set of notes, construct a specified minor scale form from a tonic, and identify the relative minor of a given Major key.</prompt>"
*   **Summary:** Section III explored the three primary forms of the Minor scale: Natural (relative to Major), Harmonic (with a raised 7th for stronger harmony), and Melodic (with raised 6th and 7th ascending, natural descending for smoother melody).
*   **Reflection:**
    "<prompt>Ask the learner to reflect: Play or listen to the three minor scales starting on the same note. How does the sound of the raised 7th in Harmonic Minor differ from Natural Minor? How does the ascending Melodic Minor sound compare to the Major scale?</prompt>"

*   (Cross-reference: `Ionian` is identical to the Major scale - See Section II. `Aeolian` is identical to the Natural Minor scale - See Section III.A)

## B. Constructing and Identifying Modes
"<prompt>Explain two primary methods for constructing modes: 1) The Parallel Method: Modifying a Major scale based on the mode's unique interval structure relative to the Major scale (e.g., Dorian is like Major with a flat 3rd and flat 7th). 2) The Derivative Method: Playing the notes of a parent Major scale but starting and ending on a different degree (e.g., D Dorian uses the same notes as C Major but starts on D).</prompt>"

### 7. Locrian Mode
*   "<prompt>Describe the Locrian mode (starting on the 7th degree of Major). Formula: H-W-W-H-W-W-W. Character: Diminished quality due to the tritone between the root and the 5th degree (lowered 5th). Example: B Locrian (derived from C Major). Parallel construction: Major scale with b2, b3, b5, b6, b7.</prompt>"
    *   "<prompt>Guide the construction of F# Locrian using both the derivative method (from G Major) and the parallel method (F# Major with b2, b3, b5, b6, b7).</prompt>"

> **Key Point:** Each mode, derived from the same set of notes as a Major scale, has a distinct color and emotional feel due to its unique interval structure relative to its starting note (tonic).

*   **Quiz:**
    "<prompt>Create a 5-question quiz testing: identifying a mode given its name and starting note (relative to a Major scale), identifying the characteristic interval of modes like Lydian (#4), Phrygian (b2), Mixolydian (b7), and constructing a specific mode (e.g., E Phrygian).</prompt>"

## A. Diatonic Chords and Scale Compatibility
"<prompt>Explain how chords are built from scales, focusing on tertian harmony (stacking thirds) using the Major scale. Show how to derive the seven diatonic triads and seventh chords of a Major key (e.g., C Major: Cmaj7, Dm7, Em7, Fmaj7, G7, Am7, Bm7b5). Explain that the parent Major scale (Ionian mode) 'fits' over all these chords, but specific modes often fit better over their corresponding chord (e.g., D Dorian over Dm7).</prompt>"
*   (Cross-reference: Review Scale Degrees from Section II.A.2 and Modes from Section IV)
*   Example: In C Major, the chord built on the 2nd degree is Dm7 (D-F-A-C). The D Dorian mode (D-E-F-G-A-B-C) contains all these chord tones and provides compatible melodic notes.
    "<prompt>List the standard diatonic chord-scale relationships for the Major scale: Imaj7-Ionian, ii_m7-Dorian, iii_m7-Phrygian, IVmaj7-Lydian, V7-Mixolydian, vi_m7-Aeolian, vii_m7b5-Locrian.</prompt>"

## B. Using Scales for Melody and Improvisation
"<prompt>Explain how knowing chord-scale relationships helps in composing melodies or improvising solos. Discuss the idea of targeting chord tones within the scale lines and using non-chord tones (passing tones, neighbor tones) from the scale to create smoother lines.</prompt>"

### 1. Targeting Chord Tones
*   "<prompt>Provide a simple chord progression (e.g., Cmaj7 - Fmaj7 - G7 - Cmaj7) and demonstrate how notes from the corresponding scales (C Ionian, F Lydian, G Mixolydian) can be used to create a melody that emphasizes the chord tones on strong beats.</prompt>"

### 2. Basic Improvisation Concepts
*   "<prompt>Introduce the idea of using Pentatonic or Blues scales as a simpler starting point for improvisation over common chord progressions, especially in blues and rock contexts.</prompt>"
    *   (Cross-reference: Pentatonic/Blues scales from Section V)

## C. Harmonization Techniques
"<prompt>Briefly explain how scales can be used to harmonize a melody. Introduce the concept of diatonic harmonization (choosing chords from the key that fit the melody note) and potentially mention parallel harmonization (moving a chord shape along a scale).</prompt>"

> **Key Point:** Scales and chords are intrinsically linked. Understanding their relationship unlocks the ability to create coherent melodies, harmonies, and improvisations.

*   **Quiz:**
    "<prompt>Create a 5-question quiz testing: identifying the diatonic seventh chord built on a specific degree of a Major scale, matching a diatonic chord with its most closely related mode, and identifying the parent scale for a simple chord progression.</prompt>"
*   **Summary:** Section VII explored the crucial connection between scales and chords (chord-scale theory), showing how diatonic chords are derived from scales and how this knowledge informs melody writing, improvisation, and harmonization.
*   **Reflection:**
    "<prompt>Ask the learner to reflect: Try playing a scale (e.g., C Major) over its corresponding tonic chord (Cmaj7). Then play the same scale over a different diatonic chord (e.g., Dm7). How does the context change the function and feel of the scale notes? How does targeting chord tones make a simple improvised line sound more connected to the harmony?</prompt>"
