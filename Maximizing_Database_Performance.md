*   Considering Cardinality: Assessing the uniqueness of data in a column.
*   Evaluating Data Types: Selecting appropriate index types for data types.

### Creating Indexes
*   Single-Column Indexes: Indexing a single column. Example: `CREATE INDEX idx_name ON users (name);`
*   Composite Indexes: Indexing multiple columns. Example: `CREATE INDEX idx_name_email ON users (name, email);`
*   Covering Indexes: Including all columns needed for a query in the index.

### Index Optimization Tips
*   Index Order: Ordering columns in composite indexes based on query patterns.
*   Using `EXPLAIN` Statement: Analyzing query execution plans to identify missing indexes.
*   Regularly Reviewing Indexes: Dropping unused or redundant indexes.

### Optimizing Joins
*   Choosing the Right Join Type: Understanding different join types (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`).
*   Join Order: Optimizing the order of tables in a join.
*   Using Indexes on Join Columns: Ensuring join columns are indexed.

### Optimizing Subqueries
*   Rewriting Subqueries as Joins: Converting subqueries into joins for better performance.
*   Using `EXISTS` vs. `IN`: Choosing the appropriate operator for subqueries.
*   Avoiding Correlated Subqueries: Replacing correlated subqueries with joins or temporary tables.

*   InnoDB vs. MyISAM: Understanding the differences in storage engines and their performance characteristics (MySQL example).
*   Choosing the Right Storage Engine: Selecting the appropriate storage engine for your workload.

### Optimizing Disk I/O
*   Using SSDs: Replacing traditional hard drives with SSDs for faster I/O.
*   RAID Configurations: Implementing RAID configurations for data redundancy and performance.
*   Data Compression: Reducing disk space usage and improving I/O performance.

## Concurrency and Locking
