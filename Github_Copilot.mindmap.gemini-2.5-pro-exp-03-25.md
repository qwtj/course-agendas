Open relevant files, write clear comments/docstrings, use meaningful variable/function names. Highlight relevant code when using chat. Use chat participants (`@workspace`) appropriately.

### Review and Verify Suggestions #CriticalThinking #Validation
Always critically review suggested code for correctness, security, and suitability. Do not blindly accept suggestions.

### Iterate and Refine #Prompting #Improvement
Break down complex tasks. Refine prompts based on initial outputs. Use chat to iterate on generated code.

### Use Specific Prompts #Clarity #Intent
Be specific about the desired language, framework, patterns, or constraints. Use slash commands (`/fix`, `/tests`) in chat.

### Security Awareness #SecureCoding #Vulnerabilities
Be vigilant about potential security issues in suggestions (hardcoded secrets, injection flaws). Ask Copilot to check for vulnerabilities (`/fix`) but verify its findings. Use alongside static analysis (SAST) and secret scanning tools.

### Manage Expectations #Limitations #Realism
Understand that Copilot is an assistant, not a replacement for developer expertise. It will make mistakes.

### Leverage Different Features Appropriately #CompletionsVsChat #Tools
