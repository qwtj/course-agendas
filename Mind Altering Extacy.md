*   Taking breaks and seeking cool spaces.

### Drug Testing and Informed Consumption
*   Using reagent test kits to identify substances.
*   Starting with a low dose and waiting to assess effects.
*   Avoiding re-dosing frequently.

### Safe Environments and Social Support
*   Being in a safe and supportive environment.
*   Having trusted friends present.
*   Knowing when and how to seek medical assistance.

*Summary: This section focused on the dangers associated with MDMA use, emphasizing the risks of adulterants and providing practical harm reduction strategies.*

# IV. Legal and Social Aspects

## Legal Status of MDMA

### International Laws and Regulations
*   MDMA's classification under international drug control conventions.
*   Varying legal statuses in different countries.

### Criminal Penalties for Possession and Distribution
*   Severity of penalties depending on jurisdiction and quantity.
*   Impact of criminal charges on individuals' lives.

## Social and Cultural Contexts

### MDMA's Role in Rave and Electronic Dance Music (EDM) Culture
*   Historical association with dance music scenes.
*   Social norms and rituals surrounding MDMA use.

### Public Perception and Stigma
*   Negative stereotypes and misconceptions about MDMA users.
*   Impact of stigma on individuals seeking help or treatment.
