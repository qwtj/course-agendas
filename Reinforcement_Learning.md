# I. Foundations of Reinforcement Learning

## Understanding Reinforcement Learning Concepts

### Defining Reinforcement Learning (RL)
*   Agent, Environment, State, Action, Reward, Policy
*   Distinguishing RL from Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

### Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
*   Defining MDP elements: States (S), Actions (A), Transition Probabilities (P), Rewards (R), Discount Factor (γ)
*   Understanding the Markov Property
*   Example: Grid World MDP

### Policies and Value Functions
*   Defining a Policy (π) as a mapping from states to actions
*   State-Value Function V(s): Expected return starting from state s and following policy π
*   Action-Value Function Q(s, a): Expected return starting from state s, taking action a, and following policy π
*   Bellman Equations for V(s) and Q(s, a)

## Implementing Simple RL Environments

### Creating a Basic Grid World Environment
*   Representing the grid as a matrix
*   Defining possible actions (e.g., up, down, left, right)
*   Implementing transition dynamics (how the agent moves)
*   Defining rewards for different states (e.g., reaching a goal, hitting a wall)

### Using Python and Libraries (e.g., NumPy, Gym)
*   Setting up a basic Python environment
*   Leveraging NumPy for array manipulations
*   Using Gym (or creating your own) for defining the environment interface

### Running Random Actions in the Environment
*   Implementing a simple agent that takes random actions
*   Observing the agent's behavior and received rewards

# II. Core RL Algorithms

## Dynamic Programming

### Policy Evaluation
*   Iteratively improving the estimate of V(s) for a given policy
*   Applying the Bellman Expectation Equation

### Policy Improvement
*   Greedily improving the policy by selecting the action that maximizes Q(s, a)

### Policy Iteration
*   Alternating between Policy Evaluation and Policy Improvement until convergence

### Value Iteration
*   Iteratively improving the estimate of V(s) until it converges to the optimal value function
*   Applying the Bellman Optimality Equation

## Monte Carlo Methods

### Monte Carlo Prediction
*   Estimating V(s) by averaging the returns observed after visiting state s in multiple episodes
*   First-Visit vs. Every-Visit Monte Carlo

### Monte Carlo Control
*   Estimating and improving the policy using Monte Carlo methods
*   ε-Greedy exploration

### On-Policy vs. Off-Policy Monte Carlo Control
*   Understanding the difference between learning the policy used to generate data (on-policy) and learning a different policy (off-policy)
*   Importance Sampling

## Temporal Difference Learning

### SARSA (On-Policy TD Control)
*   Updating Q(s, a) based on the current state, action, reward, and next state, action (SARSA tuple)
*   Implementing SARSA in a grid world

### Q-Learning (Off-Policy TD Control)
*   Updating Q(s, a) based on the current state, action, reward, and next state, and the *best* action in the next state
*   Implementing Q-Learning in a grid world

### Expected SARSA
*   Updating Q(s,a) based on the expectation of the Q values for the next state, weighted by the policy probabilities.

### TD(λ)
*   Understanding eligibility traces
*   Forward View TD(λ) and Backward View TD(λ)
*   Relationship between TD(0), TD(1), and Monte Carlo

*   Batch Gradient Descent

## Linear Function Approximation

### Feature Engineering
*   Creating relevant features from state representations (e.g., tile coding)

### Linear Models
*   Using linear models to approximate V(s) or Q(s, a)

### Applying SGD to Update Weights

## Deep Reinforcement Learning

### Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
*   Using neural networks to approximate Q(s, a)
*   Experience Replay: Storing and replaying past experiences to break correlations
*   Target Networks: Using a separate network to stabilize training

### Policy Gradient Methods
*   REINFORCE: Directly optimizing the policy by estimating the gradient of the expected return
*   Actor-Critic Methods: Using an actor to learn the policy and a critic to learn the value function

### Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C)
* Advantage function calculation and usage in updates.
* Asynchronous training across multiple agents.

### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
*   Clipping the policy update to prevent large changes

### Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
*   Learning deterministic policies in continuous action spaces
*   Using actor and critic networks
