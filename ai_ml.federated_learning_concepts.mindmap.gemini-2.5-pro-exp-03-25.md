## Core Concepts and Architecture #Fundamentals #Structure #Workflow
The foundational building blocks and operational flow of a typical Federated Learning system.
### System Architecture #Components #Roles
#### Clients / Workers #EdgeDevices #DataHolders
Entities (e.g., mobile phones, organizations) that hold local data and perform local computations.
#### Server / Aggregator / Coordinator #CentralNode #Orchestration
The central entity responsible for coordinating the training process, distributing models, and aggregating updates.
### Basic Federated Learning Process #Workflow #Steps
The iterative cycle of FL training.
#### 1. Initialization #ModelDistribution #Setup
Server selects a model and initializes its parameters.
#### 2. Client Selection #Sampling #Participation
Server selects a subset of available clients for a training round.
#### 3. Model Broadcast #Distribution #Download
Selected clients download the current global model parameters from the server.
#### 4. Local Training #ClientComputation #LocalUpdate
Clients train the downloaded model on their local data for one or more epochs.
#### 5. Model Update Upload #Communication #Upload
Clients send their computed model updates (e.g., gradients, weights) back to the server. Raw data stays local.
#### 6. Aggregation #UpdateCombination #GlobalModel
Server aggregates the received updates (e.g., averaging) to improve the global model.
#### 7. Iteration #Loop #Convergence
Repeat steps 2-6 until the model converges or a stopping criterion is met.
