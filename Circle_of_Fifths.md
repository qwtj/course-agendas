# I. Foundations of Music Theory

## Understanding Pitch and Notation

### Identifying Pitches on the Staff
*   Treble clef (G clef)
*   Bass clef (F clef)
*   Alto clef (C clef)
*   Grand staff

### Note Values and Rhythms
*   Whole note, half note, quarter note, eighth note, sixteenth note
*   Dotted notes
*   Rests
*   Time signatures (e.g., 4/4, 3/4, 6/8)

### Reading and Writing Simple Rhythms
*   Clap and count rhythms
*   Write rhythms dictated by instructor
*   Practice using a metronome

## Understanding Scales and Key Signatures

### Major Scales
*   Constructing major scales using whole and half steps
*   Identifying the pattern: W-W-H-W-W-W-H
*   C major scale
*   G major scale
*   D major scale
*   A major scale
*   E major scale
*   B major scale
*   F#/Gb major scale
*   C#/Db major scale
*   F major scale
*   Bb major scale
*   Eb major scale
*   Ab major scale
*   Db major scale

### Minor Scales
*   Natural minor scale (aeolian mode)
*   Harmonic minor scale (raised 7th)
*   Melodic minor scale (raised 6th and 7th ascending, natural minor descending)
*   Parallel and relative minor keys

### Key Signatures
*   Sharps and flats in key signatures
*   Order of sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#, A#, E#, B#
*   Order of flats: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Cb, Fb
*   Determining key from key signature (major and minor)

## Intervals

### Identifying Intervals
*   Major, minor, perfect, augmented, diminished
*   Counting half steps to determine intervals (e.g., major 3rd is 4 half steps)

### Inverting Intervals
*   Inversion rules (major becomes minor, perfect remains perfect, etc.)
*   Calculating inverted intervals

### Compound Intervals
*   Intervals larger than an octave (e.g., 9th, 11th, 13th)

# II. Harmony and Chord Progressions

## Triads

### Constructing Triads
*   Major triad (root, major 3rd, perfect 5th)
*   Minor triad (root, minor 3rd, perfect 5th)
*   Augmented triad (root, major 3rd, augmented 5th)
*   Diminished triad (root, minor 3rd, diminished 5th)

### Identifying Triads by Sound
*   Aural recognition of triad qualities

### Triads in Root Position and Inversions
*   Root position
*   First inversion
*   Second inversion

## Seventh Chords

### Types of Seventh Chords
*   Major seventh chord (major triad + major 7th)
*   Dominant seventh chord (major triad + minor 7th)
*   Minor seventh chord (minor triad + minor 7th)
*   Half-diminished seventh chord (diminished triad + minor 7th)
*   Fully diminished seventh chord (diminished triad + diminished 7th)

### Seventh Chord Notation
*   e.g., Cmaj7, G7, Am7, Bm7b5, Bdim7

### Voice Leading with Seventh Chords
*   Resolving the dominant seventh chord
*   Common seventh chord progressions

## Chord Progressions

### Diatonic Chords in Major Keys
*   Roman numeral analysis (I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii°)
*   Common chord progressions (e.g., I-IV-V-I, I-vi-IV-V)

### Diatonic Chords in Minor Keys
*   Roman numeral analysis (i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, VII)
*   Common chord progressions (e.g., i-iv-V-i, i-VI-III-VII)

### Cadences
*   Perfect authentic cadence (V-I)
*   Imperfect authentic cadence (V-I with inverted chords or non-root position)
*   Plagal cadence (IV-I)
*   Deceptive cadence (V-vi)
*   Half cadence (ends on V)

### Chord Voicing and Spacing
*   Close position
*   Open position
*   Voice leading rules (avoid parallel fifths and octaves)

# III. Advanced Concepts

## Modulation

### Types of Modulation
*   Direct modulation
*   Pivot chord modulation
*   Chromatic modulation

### Common Modulations
*   Modulating to the dominant key
*   Modulating to the subdominant key
*   Modulating to the relative minor/major

### Analyzing Modulations in Scores

## Non-Diatonic Chords

### Borrowed Chords
*   Chords borrowed from parallel keys (e.g., bVII in major key)

### Secondary Dominants
*   Dominant chords that resolve to chords other than the tonic (e.g., V/V)
*   Notation: V/V resolves to V, V/IV resolves to IV

### Augmented Sixth Chords
*   Italian augmented sixth (It+6)
*   French augmented sixth (Fr+6)
*   German augmented sixth (Ger+6)

## Form and Analysis

### Basic Forms
*   Binary form (AB)
*   Ternary form (ABA)
*   Rondo form (ABACA)
*   Theme and variations

### Sonata Form
*   Exposition
*   Development
*   Recapitulation

### Analyzing Musical Scores
*   Identifying sections
*   Analyzing harmonic progressions
*   Identifying melodic themes

# IV. Ear Training

## Interval Recognition

### Identifying Intervals by Ear
*   Practice recognizing major, minor, perfect, augmented, and diminished intervals
*   Use reference songs to associate intervals with familiar melodies

## Chord Recognition

### Recognizing Triads and Seventh Chords by Ear
*   Practice identifying major, minor, diminished, augmented triads
*   Practice identifying major seventh, minor seventh, dominant seventh chords

## Melodic Dictation

### Writing Down Melodies Played by Ear
*   Start with simple melodies and gradually increase complexity
*   Focus on identifying intervals and rhythms

## Harmonic Dictation

### Writing Down Chord Progressions Played by Ear
*   Start with simple progressions and gradually increase complexity
*   Focus on identifying chord qualities and inversions
