*   **Dependency Updates:** "<prompt>Explain the process for checking for and applying updates to Go module dependencies (`go list -u -m all`, `go get -u`) and the importance of reviewing changes and re-running tests."</prompt>
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** "<prompt>Describe the key stages in a typical CI/CD pipeline for a Go application: code checkout, dependency fetching, linting/vetting, building, testing (unit, integration), security scanning, container building, and deploying."</prompt>

*[Quiz: Deployment & Maintenance]*
"<prompt>Generate a short quiz (4-5 questions) covering Go build flags for production, cross-compilation, multi-stage Docker builds, structured logging, and dependency update procedures."</prompt>

*[Reflection: Long-Term View]*
"<prompt>Ask the learner to reflect: What changes will need to be made to your existing deployment and monitoring infrastructure/processes to accommodate the newly ported Go application? What are the long-term benefits you expect from maintaining a Go codebase versus the original Java codebase?"</prompt>

*[Summary: Section VII]*
"<prompt>Summarize Section VII, focusing on the practical aspects of deploying Go applications (building static binaries, containerization), implementing effective logging and monitoring, and establishing processes for ongoing maintenance and updates."</prompt>
