# WebRTC #Overview #RealTimeCommunication
WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a free, open-source project and specification that enables real-time communication (RTC) capabilities directly within web browsers and mobile applications via JavaScript APIs. It allows for peer-to-peer audio, video, and generic data transfer without needing plugins or external software installations. Supported by major companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla, it's built on open web standards.

## Core Concepts and Principles #Fundamentals #Basics
Underlying ideas and goals driving WebRTC technology.
### Peer-to-Peer Communication #P2P #Architecture
WebRTC primarily enables direct connections between browsers/devices (peers) for media and data exchange, reducing reliance on central servers for the actual transfer.
### Open Standard #Standardization #Interoperability
The technology is based on open web standards developed by the W3C and IETF, ensuring compatibility across different browsers and platforms.
### Plugin-Free #BrowserNative #Accessibility
WebRTC functions natively within modern web browsers, eliminating the need for users to install browser plugins or separate applications.
### Real-Time Focus #LowLatency #Performance
Designed for minimal delay (<1 second latency), making it suitable for interactive applications like video calls and gaming.
### Security by Design #Encryption #Privacy
Mandatory encryption and secure protocols are integral parts of the specification.

## Key WebRTC APIs #JavaScript #ProgrammingInterface
The primary JavaScript APIs developers use to interact with WebRTC functionalities.
### navigator.mediaDevices #MediaAccess #InputDevices
Provides access to media input devices like cameras and microphones.
#### getUserMedia() #Camera #Microphone
Captures audio and video streams from user devices after obtaining permission.
#### getDisplayMedia() #ScreenSharing #Capture
Captures screen content for sharing purposes.
### RTCPeerConnection #Connectivity #P2PSetup
The central API for establishing and managing the connection between two peers. Handles aspects like ICE negotiation, SDP handling, codec management, security, and bandwidth management.
### RTCDataChannel #DataTransfer #ArbitraryData
Enables bidirectional transfer of arbitrary data directly between peers. Uses SCTP over DTLS, offering low latency comparable to WebSockets.

## Signaling #Negotiation #Discovery
The process of coordinating communication, allowing peers to find each other and agree on connection parameters. WebRTC itself does not mandate a specific signaling mechanism.
### Purpose of Signaling #ConnectionSetup #MetadataExchange
Exchanging necessary information before a peer-to-peer connection can be established. This includes:
    *   Session control messages (initialize, close, modify session).
    *   Network configuration data (IP addresses, ports).
    *   Media capabilities (supported codecs, media formats).
### Session Description Protocol (SDP) #MediaNegotiation #Capabilities
A standard format used to describe the multimedia session parameters, such as codecs, network addresses, and media types. Peers exchange SDP "offers" and "answers" via the signaling channel to agree on session details.
#### SDP Offer/Answer Model #Handshake #NegotiationFlow
The standard mechanism where one peer sends an SDP offer describing its desired session parameters, and the other peer responds with an SDP answer indicating its parameters.
#### Key SDP Information #Details #Parameters
Includes media descriptions (audio/video), codecs, timing information, and connection details.
### Signaling Server #Broker #Coordination
A server component that facilitates the exchange of signaling messages (like SDP and ICE candidates) between peers before the direct P2P connection is established. It acts as a relay for this initial metadata exchange.
### Signaling Protocols & Transports #Implementation #Methods
Various protocols and transport mechanisms can be used for signaling.
#### Common Transports #WebSocket #HTTP #MQTT
WebSocket is frequently used due to its bidirectional nature, but HTTP or other protocols like MQTT are also possible.
#### Common Protocols #SIP #XMPP #Custom
While WebRTC doesn't mandate one, protocols like SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) over WebSocket or XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) are sometimes used. Many developers create custom signaling protocols tailored to their application.

## Networking and Connectivity #NATTraversal #ICE #STUN #TURN
Mechanisms required to establish direct connections between peers, especially when they are behind NATs (Network Address Translators) and firewalls.
### NAT Traversal Problem #Firewalls #PrivateIPs
Peers often don't have direct public IP addresses, residing behind NATs or firewalls that block incoming connections, making direct P2P communication difficult.
### Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) #Framework #PathFinding
A framework used by WebRTC to find the best possible path for connecting peers.
#### Candidate Gathering #AddressCollection #Possibilities
ICE collects potential connection addresses (candidates) for each peer, including local network addresses, public addresses discovered via STUN, and relay addresses from TURN servers.
#### Connectivity Checks #PathTesting #Validation
ICE sends STUN requests between candidate pairs to test if a direct connection is possible and determine the most efficient path.
#### Path Selection #Optimization #BestRoute
Based on connectivity checks, ICE selects the optimal path, prioritizing direct P2P connections.
### Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) #PublicIPDiscovery #NATType
A protocol and server type used to discover a peer's public IP address and port, and to determine the type of NAT it's behind. STUN is lightweight and helps establish direct connections when NAT restrictions are not too severe.
#### STUN Server Role #Helper #AddressResolver
Responds to requests from peers, informing them of their public-facing IP address and port as seen by the server.
### Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) #RelayServer #Fallback
A protocol and server type that relays media traffic between peers when a direct P2P connection cannot be established due to restrictive NATs (like Symmetric NAT) or firewalls.
#### TURN Server Role #Mediator #TrafficRelay
Acts as an intermediary, receiving media from one peer and forwarding it to the other. This ensures connectivity but adds latency and server load, so it's used as a fallback.
#### Symmetric NAT #Challenge #Restriction
A type of NAT where the mapping depends on the destination address, often preventing connections discovered via STUN. TURN is needed to bypass this.

## Media Processing #Audio #Video #Codecs
Handling audio and video streams, including capture, encoding, decoding, and quality adaptation.
### Media Capture #Input #getUserMedia
Accessing raw audio/video streams from microphones, cameras, or screen sharing via `navigator.mediaDevices`.
### Codecs (Coder-Decoder) #Compression #Decompression
Algorithms used to compress (encode) raw media data for efficient transmission and decompress (decode) it for playback. Codecs impact quality, latency, bandwidth usage, and compatibility.
#### Mandatory Audio Codecs #Compatibility #Requirements
WebRTC mandates support for specific audio codecs to ensure interoperability.
##### Opus #HighQuality #Versatile
A versatile, open, royalty-free codec effective for both speech and music, offering high quality across various bitrates. Mandatory support specified in RFC 7874.
##### G.711 (PCMA/PCMU) #Telephony #Legacy
Older, narrowband codecs common in telephony systems (POTS quality). Mandatory support specified in RFC 7874.
#### Mandatory Video Codecs #Compatibility #Requirements
WebRTC mandates support for specific video codecs.
##### H.264 (AVC) #WidelyCompatible #Efficient
A widely adopted codec known for good compression efficiency and broad hardware support. Constrained Baseline Profile is mandatory. Licensing considerations may apply.
##### VP8 #OpenSource #RoyaltyFree
An open-source, royalty-free codec developed by Google, offering competitive quality and compression.
#### Optional/Emerging Codecs #Advanced #Future
Other codecs gaining support or relevance.
##### VP9 #ImprovedCompression #Google
Successor to VP8, offering better compression efficiency.
##### AV1 #RoyaltyFree #NextGen
A newer, open, royalty-free codec designed for internet video, offering significant compression improvements over H.264 and VP9.
##### H.265 (HEVC) #HighEfficiency #Licensing
Offers higher compression than H.264 but often involves complex licensing.
#### Codec Negotiation #SDP #Agreement
Peers use SDP during signaling to determine which compatible codecs to use for the session.
### Media Transport #RTP #SRTP
Protocols used for transporting media data.
#### Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) #Streaming #Packetization
The standard protocol for delivering audio and video over IP networks.
#### Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) #Encryption #MediaSecurity
An encrypted and authenticated version of RTP, mandatory for all WebRTC media streams.
### Media Quality Adaptation #NetworkResilience #Adjustments
Techniques to handle network fluctuations and packet loss.
#### Adaptive Bitrate #DynamicQuality #BandwidthManagement
Adjusting video/audio quality (bitrate) based on available network bandwidth to maintain smooth playback.
#### Packet Loss Concealment (PLC) #AudioCorrection #ErrorHiding
Techniques, especially for audio, to mask the effects of lost packets, often by interpolating or repeating previous audio data.
#### Forward Error Correction (FEC) #Redundancy #ProactiveCorrection
Sending redundant data alongside the main media stream, allowing the receiver to reconstruct lost packets without needing retransmission.
#### Retransmissions (RTX) #ReactiveCorrection #PacketRecovery
Requesting the sender to retransmit lost RTP packets. Less effective for real-time due to latency, but sometimes used.

## Data Channel (RTCDataChannel) #ArbitraryData #P2PTransfer
Mechanism for sending non-media data between peers.
### Functionality #Bidirectional #LowLatency
Allows sending text, files, game state updates, or any arbitrary binary data directly peer-to-peer.
### Underlying Protocol (SCTP over DTLS) #Reliability #Security
Uses Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) tunneled over DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) for secure and reliable (or unreliable/unordered) data transport.
### Use Cases #FileSharing #Chat #Gaming
Used for features like in-call text chat, peer-to-peer file sharing, and real-time gaming data synchronization.

## Security #Encryption #Privacy #Authentication
Security is a mandatory and fundamental aspect of WebRTC.
### Mandatory Encryption #SRTP #DTLS
All WebRTC communications are encrypted.
    *   Media streams are encrypted using SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol).
    *   Data channels and the SRTP key exchange use DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security).
### Secure Key Exchange #DTLSHandshake #Confidentiality
Encryption keys for SRTP are securely exchanged using DTLS handshakes, often aiming for Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).
### Secure Signaling #HTTPS #WSS
The signaling channel used to set up the connection should be secured (e.g., using HTTPS or WSS - Secure WebSockets) to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks during negotiation.
### Browser Security Context #Permissions #UserConsent
WebRTC APIs require a secure context (HTTPS). User permission is explicitly required to access cameras, microphones, or screens. Browsers provide visual indicators when devices are in use.
### IP Address Leakage #PrivacyConcern #Mitigation
Potential privacy issue where a user's real IP address might be revealed via ICE candidates, even when using a VPN. Mitigation strategies exist, often involving careful use of TURN servers or browser settings.
### Authentication and Authorization #Identity #AccessControl
WebRTC itself doesn't mandate a specific user authentication mechanism; this is typically handled by the application layer using methods like credential checks or tokens.

## WebRTC Architectures #Topology #Scalability
Different ways to structure WebRTC applications, especially for multi-party communication.
### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) / Mesh #DirectConnection #SimpleCalls
Each participant connects directly to every other participant. Simple for small groups (e.g., 1-to-1 calls) but scales poorly as the number of connections (and required upload bandwidth) increases quadratically.
### Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) #MediaRouter #ScalableVideo
Participants send their media stream once to a central SFU server. The SFU then forwards the received streams to other participants as needed. Reduces client upload bandwidth and CPU load compared to mesh, making it suitable for larger group calls.
### Multipoint Conferencing Unit (MCU) #MixingServer #ResourceIntensive
An MCU server receives streams from all participants, decodes them, mixes them into a single composite stream (like a grid view), encodes the composite stream, and sends it back to each participant. Simplifies client requirements but demands significant server resources for mixing.
