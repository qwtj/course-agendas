# Test Driven Development (TDD) #SoftwareDevelopment #Agile #Testing
An evolutionary approach to development where tests are written before the code they are intended to validate.

## Core Concepts and Principles #Fundamentals #Theory #Definition
Fundamental ideas underpinning the TDD approach.

### Definition of TDD #Concept #Explanation
Writing a failing automated test before writing the production code to make it pass.

### Test-First Development #Principle #Approach
The practice of writing tests before the feature code.

### Kent Beck's Three Laws of TDD #Rules #Guidance
1. Write production code only to pass a failing unit test.
2. Write no more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail (compilation failures count).
3. Write no more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

### Focus on Simple Design #Design #Simplicity #YAGNI
TDD encourages emergent design and avoiding unnecessary complexity (You Ain't Gonna Need It).

### Fast Feedback Loop #Agile #DevelopmentCycle #Feedback
Rapid confirmation that code changes meet requirements and haven't broken existing functionality.

## The TDD Cycle: Red-Green-Refactor #Process #Workflow #CoreLoop
The fundamental rhythm of Test Driven Development.

### Red Phase: Write a Failing Test #Testing #Failure #Requirement
Define a small piece of desired functionality by writing a test that will fail because the functionality doesn't exist yet.
#### Characteristics of the Red Phase #State #Goal
*   Test should fail for the *expected* reason (e.g., unimplemented method, incorrect logic).
*   Test should be specific and test one thing.
*   Test code should be clear and readable.

### Green Phase: Make the Test Pass #Implementation #Coding #Success
Write the *minimum* amount of production code necessary to make the failing test pass.
#### Characteristics of the Green Phase #State #Goal
*   Focus is solely on passing the current failing test.
*   Code written may not be optimal or clean initially.
*   Avoid adding functionality not specifically required by the test.

### Refactor Phase: Improve the Code #CodeQuality #Design #Cleanup
Clean up the code (both production and test code) while ensuring all tests still pass.
#### Characteristics of the Refactor Phase #State #Goal
*   Improve readability, maintainability, and structure.
*   Remove duplication (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself).
*   Optimize algorithms or logic if necessary.
*   Ensure no change in observable behavior (tests remain green).

## Types of Tests in TDD Context #Testing #Scope #Levels
Different granularities of tests commonly used with or related to TDD.

### Unit Tests #Microtesting #Isolation #Component
Tests focusing on the smallest testable parts (units) of an application, typically classes or methods, in isolation.
#### Role in TDD #PrimaryFocus #DevelopmentLoop
The primary type of test written during the core Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

### Integration Tests #Interaction #Collaboration #Modules
Tests verifying the interaction between several units or components, including external dependencies like databases or APIs.
#### Role in TDD #SystemBehavior #Verification
Often written using TDD principles but may occur less frequently than unit tests; verify collaborations.

### Acceptance / Functional Tests #Requirements #BusinessValue #EndToEnd
Tests verifying that the system meets business requirements or user acceptance criteria, often testing larger slices of functionality.
#### Role in TDD #OuterLoop #Validation
Can drive development at a higher level (e.g., ATDD/BDD), with unit TDD used for the inner implementation loop.

## Test Doubles (Mocks, Stubs, Fakes, Spies, Dummies) #Isolation #TestingTechniques #Dependencies
Objects used in place of real dependencies to isolate the unit under test.

### Stubs #StateVerification #Queries
Provide canned answers to calls made during the test.

### Mocks #BehaviorVerification #Commands
Objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive.

### Fakes #SimplifiedImplementation #WorkingAlternative
Objects that have working implementations, but are simplified versions (e.g., in-memory database).

### Spies #Hybrid #StateAndBehavior
Stubs that also record some information about how they were called.

### Dummies #Placeholders #Nulls
Objects passed around but never actually used. Usually just satisfy parameter lists.

### Misunderstanding and Misapplication #AntiPatterns #IncorrectUsage
Applying TDD incorrectly can negate its benefits (e.g., writing tests after code).

## TDD Best Practices #Guidelines #Recommendations #EffectiveTDD
Tips for applying TDD effectively.

### Keep Tests Small and Focused #UnitTest #SingleResponsibility #Clarity
Each test should verify one specific aspect or behavior.

### Test Behavior, Not Implementation #BlackBox #Contract #Robustness
Focus tests on *what* a unit does, not *how* it does it.

### Write Readable and Maintainable Tests #Clarity #TestCodeQuality #AAA
Tests should be clear, concise, and easy to understand (Arrange-Act-Assert pattern).

### Run Tests Frequently #FeedbackLoop #CI #Automation
Integrate test execution into the development workflow and CI/CD pipelines.

### Refactor Test Code Too #TestHygiene #DRY #Readability
Treat test code as first-class code; keep it clean and well-structured.

### Ensure Test Independence #Isolation #Reproducibility #Parallelism
Tests should not depend on each other or run order.

## Common TDD Anti-Patterns #Mistakes #Pitfalls #IneffectiveTDD
Practices that undermine the goals and benefits of TDD.

### Writing Tests After Code #FakeTDD #TestingLast
Defeats the purpose of test-first design and feedback.

### Tests That Are Too Large or Coarse-Grained #IntegrationTestAsUnit #Complexity
Makes pinpointing failures difficult and slows feedback.

### Testing Private Methods #ImplementationDetail #EncapsulationViolation #Brittleness
Leads to brittle tests coupled to implementation specifics.

### Excessive Mocking #OverMocking #WhiteBox #TestComplexity
Can make tests complex and tightly coupled to the implementation.

### Ignoring the Refactor Step #SkippingRefactoring #TechnicalDebt #CodeQuality
Leads to accumulation of technical debt and negates design benefits.

### Fragile Tests #Brittleness #MaintenanceHell
Tests that break frequently due to minor, unrelated code changes.

### Asserting Too Much in One Test #MultipleAssertions #LackOfFocus
Makes it hard to determine the exact cause of failure.
