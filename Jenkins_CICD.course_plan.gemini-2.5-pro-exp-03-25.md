## Pipeline Concepts
"Starting with heading level 2, introduce the fundamental building blocks and terminology used in Jenkins Pipelines."

### `pipeline` block
"Starting with heading level 3, explain that the `pipeline` block is the root element enclosing the entire definition for Declarative Pipelines."

### `agent` directive
"Starting with heading level 3, explain the `agent` directive. Describe its purpose: to specify where the entire Pipeline, or a specific stage, will execute (e.g., `agent any`, `agent { node { label 'linux' } }`, `agent { docker { image 'maven:3.9.0-eclipse-temurin-17' } }`). Mention it determines the execution context and workspace."

### `stages` block
"Starting with heading level 3, explain the `stages` block. Describe it as the container for the main work sections of the Pipeline, representing distinct logical phases of the workflow (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy)."

### `stage` directive
"Starting with heading level 3, explain the `stage` directive. Describe how each `stage` block defines a specific phase within the `stages` block. Mention that stages are visualized in the Jenkins UI and typically contain `steps`."

### `steps` block
"Starting with heading level 3, explain the `steps` block within a `stage`. Describe it as containing the actual tasks, commands, or scripts to be executed (e.g., running shell commands `sh`, executing build tools `mvn`, archiving artifacts `archiveArtifacts`)."

### `post` block
"Starting with heading level 3, explain the `post` block. Describe its purpose: to define actions that run at the *end* of a Pipeline run or a specific `stage`, based on the outcome (e.g., `always`, `success`, `failure`, `cleanup`). Useful for notifications, cleanup, etc."

## Declarative Pipeline Syntax
"Starting with heading level 2, describe the Declarative Pipeline syntax. Emphasize that it's a more recent, structured, and generally recommended syntax offering a simpler way to define pipelines compared to Scripted Pipeline."

### Syntax Structure

### Environment Variables (`environment`)
"Starting with heading level 3, explain the `environment` directive. Describe how it's used to define environment variables available to steps within the Pipeline or a specific stage. Mention its use for setting configurations or managing secrets via `credentials()` helper."
*   "Show an example `environment` block: `environment { MY_VAR = 'value' DB_CREDS = credentials('my-db-creds') }`"

### Options (`options`)
"Starting with heading level 3, explain the `options` directive. Describe how it allows configuration of Pipeline-specific options, such as setting build timeouts (`timeout`), retry counts (`retry`), skipping default SCM checkout (`skipDefaultCheckout`), or preserving stash (`preserveStashes`)."

### Parameters (`parameters`)
"Starting with heading level 3, explain the `parameters` directive. Describe how it allows defining parameters that users can provide when manually triggering the Pipeline (e.g., `string`, `boolean`, `choice`)."
*   "Show an example `parameters` block: `parameters { string(name: 'BRANCH', defaultValue: 'main', description: 'Branch to build') booleanParam(name: 'DEPLOY', defaultValue: false, description: 'Deploy to staging?') }`"

### When (`when`)
"Starting with heading level 3, explain the `when` directive. Describe its use for conditionally executing a `stage` based on criteria like branch name (`branch`), environment variables (`environment`), or expressions (`expression`)."
*   "Show an example `when` block within a stage: `stage('Deploy') { when { branch 'main' } steps { sh './deploy.sh' } }`"

### Matrix (`matrix`)
"Starting with heading level 3, explain the `matrix` directive. Describe how it allows running a set of stages in parallel with different combinations of parameters (axes), useful for testing across multiple environments or configurations."
*   "Show a simple example `matrix` block: `matrix { axes { axis { name 'PLATFORM' values 'linux', 'windows' } axis { name 'BROWSER' values 'firefox', 'chrome' } } stages { stage('Test') { steps { sh "echo Testing on ${PLATFORM} with ${BROWSER}" } } } }`"

## Scripted Pipeline Syntax
"Starting with heading level 2, describe the Scripted Pipeline syntax. Explain that it's based on Apache Groovy, offering more flexibility and programmability than Declarative but can be more complex. Mention it was the original Pipeline syntax."

### Groovy Syntax
"Starting with heading level 3, highlight that Scripted Pipelines use Groovy syntax, allowing for typical programming constructs like variables, control structures (`if`/`else`), loops (`for`, `while`), and function calls."

### `node` block
"Starting with heading level 3, explain the `node` block in Scripted Pipeline. Describe its role: allocating an executor on an agent and creating a workspace, similar to the `agent` directive in Declarative."
*   "Show a basic Scripted Pipeline example: `node('linux') { stage('Build') { sh 'mvn clean install' } stage('Test') { sh 'mvn test' } }`"

### Error Handling (`try`/`catch`/`finally`)

### Structure of Shared Library
"Starting with heading level 3, describe the standard directory structure of a Shared Library repository: the `vars` directory for global variables and custom steps, the `src` directory for Groovy classes, and the `resources` directory for associated non-Groovy files."

### Defining Global Variables (`vars`)
"Starting with heading level 3, explain that `.groovy` files in the `vars` directory define global variables, often implementing custom Pipeline steps. Describe how a file like `vars/myCustomStep.groovy` containing a `call` method can be invoked as `myCustomStep()` in a Pipeline."

### Defining Classes (`src`)
"Starting with heading level 3, explain that the `src` directory (`src/com/myorg/Utils.groovy`, for example) follows standard Groovy source structure and allows defining classes that can be imported and used within Pipelines for more complex logic or state management."

### Loading Shared Libraries
"Starting with heading level 3, explain the two ways to load Shared Libraries: Implicitly (by configuring a global library in Jenkins settings) and Explicitly using the `@Library` annotation at the top of a `Jenkinsfile` (`@Library('my-shared-library') _`)."
