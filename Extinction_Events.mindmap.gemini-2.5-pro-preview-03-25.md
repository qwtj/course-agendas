# Extinction Events #Overview #GeologicalHistory #BiodiversityCrisis
The study of large-scale losses of biodiversity throughout Earth's history and the ongoing crisis.

## Defining Extinction Events #Concepts #Terminology #Scale
Understanding the fundamental nature and types of extinction.
### What is Extinction? #Definition #Biology
The termination of an organism or group of organisms (taxon), usually a species.
### Types of Extinction #Classification
Categorizing different forms and scales of extinction.
#### Background Extinction #NormalRate #Evolution
The standard, ongoing rate of extinction occurring between mass extinction events, driven by normal ecological and evolutionary processes.
#### Mass Extinction #Catastrophe #GlobalImpact #GeologicalTime
Geologically rapid, widespread, and significant decreases in Earth's biodiversity, affecting multiple unrelated taxa across different environments.
#### Regional/Local Extinction (Extirpation) #Geography #Population
The cessation of a species' existence within a specific geographic area of study, though it exists elsewhere.
#### Functional Extinction #Ecology #RoleLoss
The reduction of a species to such low abundance that, although still present, it no longer interacts significantly with its ecosystem or plays its functional role.
#### Extinction Debt #DelayedEffect #Ecosystems
The future extinction of species due to events in the past, such as habitat fragmentation, whose full impact has not yet been realized.
### Measuring Extinction #Metrics #Rate #Magnitude
Quantifying the severity and speed of extinction events.
#### Extinction Rate (e.g., E/MSY) #Quantification #Paleontology
Typically measured as extinctions per million species-years (E/MSY) to compare rates across different geological times.
#### Magnitude (% species lost) #Severity #Comparison
The proportion of total estimated species that disappeared during an event.

## Causes of Extinction Events #Drivers #Mechanisms #Origins
Exploring the various triggers for extinction events, both natural and human-caused.
### Natural Causes (Intrinsic & Extrinsic) #Geology #Climate #Biology
Factors originating from Earth systems or extraterrestrial events.
#### Climate Change (Global Warming/Cooling) #Temperature #SeaLevel
Significant shifts in global temperature patterns, precipitation, and seasonality affecting habitats. Includes rapid cooling (ice ages) and warming periods.
#### Asteroid/Comet Impacts #Bolide #Chicxulub #ImpactWinter
Collisions with large extraterrestrial bodies causing immediate destruction and subsequent climatic disruption (e.g., impact winter, tsunamis).
#### Volcanic Activity (Flood Basalts) #LIPs #Atmosphere #SiberianTraps #DeccanTraps
Massive volcanic eruptions, particularly Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs), releasing greenhouse gases, aerosols, and causing climate change, acid rain, and anoxia.
#### Sea Level Changes #Regression #Transgression #HabitatLoss
Major fluctuations in sea level altering coastal and shallow marine habitats, driven by climate change or tectonics.
#### Anoxia/Euxinia Events (Ocean Chemistry) #OxygenDepletion #MarineLife
Depletion of dissolved oxygen (anoxia) or presence of hydrogen sulfide (euxinia) in large parts of the ocean, often linked to climate change and nutrient runoff.
#### Plate Tectonics #ContinentalDrift #HabitatChange #ClimatePatterns
Slow movement of continents altering ocean currents, climate patterns, causing habitat fragmentation or amalgamation, and triggering volcanism.
#### Gamma-Ray Bursts #Astrophysics #Atmosphere #OzoneLayer
Hypothesized astrophysical events that could strip Earth's ozone layer, increasing harmful UV radiation.
#### Biological Factors (Competition, Disease, Predation) #Evolution #Pathogens
Intrinsic biological interactions that can drive species or groups to extinction, often exacerbated by environmental changes.
### Anthropogenic Causes #HumanImpact #Anthropocene #Conservation
Extinction drivers linked directly or indirectly to human activities, particularly prominent in the modern era.
#### Habitat Destruction/Fragmentation #LandUse #Deforestation #Urbanization
The conversion, degradation, and breaking apart of natural habitats for agriculture, settlement, infrastructure, and resource extraction.
#### Overexploitation (Hunting, Fishing, Harvesting) #ResourceUse #PopulationDecline
Harvesting species at unsustainable rates, leading to population collapse and extinction.
#### Invasive Species and Diseases #Competition #Predation #Pathogens
Introduction of non-native species that outcompete, prey upon, or spread diseases to native species.
#### Pollution (Chemical, Plastic, Light, Noise) #Toxicity #Environment
Introduction of harmful substances or disturbances into the environment affecting organism health, reproduction, and survival.
#### Human-Induced Climate Change #GlobalWarming #FossilFuels #ModernEra
Rapid global warming driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, causing widespread environmental changes.

## The "Big Five" Mass Extinctions #Paleozoic #Mesozoic #History

#### Impacts (Largest extinction, >90% marine, >70% terrestrial species) #Insects #Synapsids #PaleozoicFauna
Catastrophic loss of life across marine and terrestrial realms, including the only known mass extinction of insects. Paved the way for the rise of archosaurs.

#### Impacts (Large Amphibians, Reptiles, Marine Reptiles) #DinosaursRise #Conodonts
Eliminated many large amphibians, non-dinosaurian archosaurs, therapsids, and marine reptiles, allowing dinosaurs to become dominant in the Jurassic. Conodonts went extinct.
### Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction (K-Pg, formerly K-T, ~66 Mya) #Cretaceous #Paleogene #Dinosaurs
Famous for the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs.
#### Causes (Chicxulub Asteroid Impact, Deccan Traps Volcanism) #ImpactEvent #Volcanism #ClimateDisruption
A combination of the Chicxulub impact in Yucatan and concurrent Deccan Traps volcanism in India led to global environmental catastrophe (impact winter, wildfires, acid rain).
#### Impacts (Non-avian Dinosaurs, Pterosaurs, Ammonites, Marine Reptiles) #MammalRadiation #BirdsSurvive
Extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs, ammonites, large marine reptiles (mosasaurs, plesiosaurs), and many plankton groups. Led to the adaptive radiation of mammals and birds.
