# Neoproterozoic Era #GeologicTime #Precambrian
The Neoproterozoic Era is the final era of the Proterozoic Eon, lasting from 1,000 million years ago (Mya) to 538.8 Mya. It is the last era of the Precambrian "supereon" and precedes the Paleozoic Era of the Phanerozoic Eon. It represents a pivotal time in Earth's history, marked by dramatic climatic shifts, tectonic reorganizations, and crucial evolutionary developments, including the rise of multicellular life. [1, 3, 5]

## Definition and Chronology #Timescale #Geochronology
Defining the timeframe and position of the Neoproterozoic within Earth's history.

### Timespan #Duration #Boundaries

## Tectonics and Paleogeography #PlateTectonics #Supercontinents
Major movements and configurations of continents during the era.

### Supercontinent Cycles #Rodinia #Pannotia
#### Rodinia #Supercontinent #Tonian
*   Assembly completed in late Mesoproterozoic/early Tonian (~1.26-0.9 Ga). [6]
*   Centered around the equator at the start of the Neoproterozoic. [1, 3, 5]
*   Breakup initiated during the Tonian (~825-750 Ma), possibly triggered by superplume activity or collision events. [3, 5, 6, 8, 20]
*   Fragments included Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia, Amazonia, Congo, Kalahari, Australia, Antarctica, India, North/South China. [6, 8]

#### Pannotia (Greater Gondwana) #Supercontinent #Ediacaran
*   Formation: Late Neoproterozoic (~650–550 Ma), during the Pan-African orogeny. [6, 8, 17]
*   Resulted from the collision/reassembly of Rodinia fragments (turned "inside out"). [8, 17, 21]
*   Centered around the South Pole. [17]
*   Relatively short-lived supercontinent. [17]
*   Breakup began ~560 Ma with the opening of the Iapetus Ocean. [8, 17]
*   Note: Existence/configuration of Pannotia is debated. [6, 17, 20]

### Major Orogenies #MountainBuilding #Geology
Periods of mountain formation associated with continental collisions.
#### Grenville Orogeny #Grenville #RodiniaAssembly
*   While peaking earlier, its effects relate to Rodinia's formation (~1.3-1.0 Ga). [1, 6, 20]
*   Evidence found in eastern North America and other formerly connected cratons. [6, 20]

#### Pan-African Orogeny #PanAfrican #PannotiaAssembly
*   Series of collisional events assembling Pannotia/Gondwana (~750–530 Ma). [8, 17, 21]
*   Peak activity ~640–610 Ma. [17, 21]
*   Resulted in significant crustal formation, making the Neoproterozoic a major period of continental crust generation. [1]
*   Key event: Collision between East and West Gondwana (East African Orogeny). [17]

### Rifting Events #Rifting #Tectonics
Stretching and splitting of continental crust.
#### Keweenawan Rift (Midcontinent Rift) #NorthAmerica #Rifting
*   Early rifting associated with Rodinia (~1.1 Ga), though ultimately failed to split Laurentia. [20]
#### Iapetus Ocean Opening #PaleoOcean #Ediacaran
*   Began opening ~560 Ma, signaling the breakup of Pannotia. [17]
*   Separated Laurentia from Baltica and Gondwana fragments. [17]

## Climate #Paleoclimate #Glaciation
Characterized by extreme climate fluctuations, notably severe ice ages.

### Snowball Earth Hypothesis #SnowballEarth #Cryogenian
The hypothesis posits that Earth's surface became entirely or nearly entirely frozen during parts of the Cryogenian. [1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 11]
#### Major Glacial Episodes #IceAges #Sturtian #Marinoan
*   Sturtian Glaciation (~720/717 – ~660 Mya): Longest episode, possibly ~50-60 million years. [2, 7, 12]
*   Marinoan Glaciation (~650/645 – ~635 Mya): Second major global glaciation. [2, 7, 12]
*   Gaskiers Glaciation (~580 Mya, Ediacaran): Shorter, likely less severe, perhaps not fully global. [2]

#### Evidence #GlacialDeposits #Geochemistry
*   Glacial Deposits at Low Latitudes: Tillites and diamictites found on continents positioned near the equator during the Cryogenian. [1, 2, 7]
*   Cap Carbonates: Distinctive layers of carbonate rock directly overlying glacial deposits, suggesting rapid climate shift and ocean chemistry changes post-glaciation. [2, 4, 9, 11]
*   Dropstones: Large clasts found in finely laminated deep-water sediments, indicating transport by icebergs. [2]
*   Banded Iron Formations (BIFs): Reappearance after a long absence, suggesting widespread ocean anoxia beneath ice cover. [2, 25]
*   Carbon Isotope Excursions (δ¹³C): Extreme negative shifts before and after glaciations, potentially linked to biological productivity collapse or changes in carbon cycling. [9, 10, 11, 25]

#### Potential Causes #ClimateDrivers #Tectonics
*   Rodinia Breakup: Increased weathering of newly exposed rock, drawing down atmospheric CO₂. [7, 10]
*   Low-Latitude Continents: Enhanced weathering in tropics; lack of high-latitude land for ice sheet "safety switch". [1, 3, 10, 11, 12]
*   Volcanic Activity: Initial cooling from aerosols, subsequent massive CO₂ buildup under ice leading to rapid warming. [7, 9]
*   Biological Triggers: Changes in marine ecosystems affecting carbon export and alkalinity. [10]
*   Solar Luminosity: Sun was slightly fainter (~6% less) than today, making Earth more susceptible to cooling. [11]
*   Asteroid Impact: Impact winter potentially triggering runaway ice-albedo feedback. [12]

#### Aftermath #GreenhouseEffect #OceanChemistry
*   Extreme Greenhouse Conditions: Massive volcanic CO₂ buildup under ice led to rapid warming upon melting. [9, 11]
*   Rapid Carbonate Precipitation: Formation of cap carbonates as CO₂ dissolved into warming oceans. [9]
*   Ocean Chemistry Changes: Fluctuations in alkalinity, potential for widespread anoxia followed by oxygenation. [2, 9, 10]

## Atmospheric and Oceanic Changes #Geochemistry #Paleoenvironment
Significant shifts in the composition of Earth's atmosphere and oceans.

### Oxygenation Events #Oxygen #Atmosphere #Ocean
Rise in atmospheric and oceanic oxygen levels.
#### Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event (NOE) #NOE #Oxygenation
*   Debated timing, possibly occurring gradually or in pulses throughout the era, particularly later stages (Ediacaran). [19, 25, 27]
*   Evidence: Geochemical proxies (e.g., trace metal enrichments, sulfur isotopes). [27]
*   Potential Drivers: Increased organic carbon burial, tectonic activity, evolution of photosynthetic organisms (e.g., cyanobacteria). [10, 19, 23, 27]
*   Consequences: Allowed for the evolution of aerobic respiration and larger, more complex life (Metazoa). [26, 27]
*   Complexity: Oxygen levels likely fluctuated, with periods of widespread ocean anoxia (sulfidic or ferruginous) persisting even as atmospheric O₂ rose. [2, 27]

### Carbon Cycle Instability #CarbonCycle #Isotopes
Marked by large fluctuations in carbon isotope ratios (δ¹³C). [9, 10, 25, 27]
#### Negative δ¹³C Excursions #Geochemistry #Climate
*   Associated with pre- and post-glacial intervals (e.g., Islay, Trezona, Shuram/Wonoka anomalies). [9, 10, 27]
*   Interpreted as major perturbations in the global carbon cycle, possibly linked to productivity collapse, methane release, or enhanced organic matter remineralization. [9, 10]

### Other Geochemical Signatures #Geochemistry #Isotopes
#### Strontium Isotopes (⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr) #Weathering #Tectonics
*   Variations reflect changes in continental weathering rates, linked to tectonics and climate. [27]
#### Banded Iron Formations (BIFs) #BIFs #OceanAnoxia
*   Brief reappearance during Cryogenian glaciations suggests widespread anoxic deep ocean conditions beneath ice. [2, 25]

### Origin of Multicellularity and Animals (Metazoa) #Metazoa #Animals #Evolution
The Neoproterozoic witnessed the emergence of complex multicellular life.
#### Early Fossils and Molecular Clocks #Fossils #Genetics
*   Molecular clock estimates suggest animal origins deep in the Neoproterozoic (Tonian or earlier, ~800 Mya or before), but fossil evidence is sparse/debated. [1, 19]
*   *Otavia* (Tonian): Interpreted by some as a primitive sponge. [1]
*   Possible sponge fossils ~890 Mya (unconfirmed). [1]
*   Possible eukaryotic embryos ~600 Mya (Doushantuo Formation, China). [15]

#### Ediacaran Biota (~575–538.8 Mya) #EdiacaranBiota #Fossils #Paleontology

*   Distribution: Found globally (e.g., Australia, Newfoundland, Russia, Namibia, China, UK). [3, 15, 18, 26]
*   Taphonomy (Preservation): Unique preservation styles (e.g., Flinders, Conception, Nama) influenced by microbial mats and rapid burial. [14, 16, 18]
*   Biological Affinities: Highly debated; interpretations include stem/crown group animals (cnidarians, bilaterians), "failed experiments", giant protists (xenophyophores), fungi, lichens. [3, 4, 14, 15, 16, 18]
*   Key Taxa: *Charnia*, *Dickinsonia*, *Spriggina*, *Kimberella*, *Tribrachidium*, *Cyclomedusa*, *Pteridinium*, *Ernietta*. [4, 15]
*   Ecological Developments: Evidence for niche partitioning, mobility (*Kimberella*, *Dickinsonia* trace fossils), possible predation, biomineralization (late Ediacaran, e.g., *Cloudina*, *Namacalathus*). [14, 15, 18]
*   Biotic Assemblages: Distinct faunal groups appear over time (Avalon, White Sea, Nama assemblages). [4, 16]

## Economic Significance #Resources #Petroleum
Potential for resource exploration.

### Petroleum Systems #Hydrocarbons #SourceRocks
*   Neoproterozoic source rocks exist and contribute to hydrocarbon reserves (e.g., Huqf Supergroup in Oman, Nepa Formation in Siberia). [8, 13, 22, 24]

### The Cambrian Explosion #Evolution #Diversity
*   Rapid diversification of animal phyla with hard skeletons shortly after the Neoproterozoic ended. [4, 8, 14, 17]
*   Possible links to Neoproterozoic events:
    *   Increased oxygen levels enabling larger bodies and higher metabolisms. [26, 27]
