*   "<prompt>Question 6: Name one common issue that can cause I2C communication to fail.</prompt>"
*   "<prompt>Question 7: What do CPOL and CPHA define in the SPI protocol?</prompt>"

## Scenario-Based Problem Solving
"<prompt>Present a short scenario describing an embedded system requirement (e.g., reading multiple temperature sensors accurately and interfacing with a high-speed display) and ask the learner to propose suitable communication protocols and justify their choices.</prompt>"
*   "<prompt>Scenario: You need to design a weather station that reads temperature and humidity from one sensor (low update rate), barometric pressure from another (moderate update rate), and wind speed/direction from a third sensor that streams data rapidly. You also need to display all information on a graphical LCD. Propose which protocols (UART, I2C, SPI) you would consider for each sensor interface and the display, and explain your reasoning, considering pin counts and speed requirements.</prompt>"

## Final Reflection
"<prompt>Generate a final reflective prompt encouraging the learner to consider how they would approach debugging a non-functional sensor interface in a real project, based on the knowledge gained.</prompt>"
*   "<prompt>Reflect on the debugging techniques learned for UART, I2C, and SPI. If you connected a new sensor to your microcontroller and it wasn't communicating, what would be your systematic approach to troubleshooting the problem? List the steps you would take.</prompt>"

## Further Exploration
"<prompt>Provide placeholder links or suggestions for further learning resources.</prompt>"
*   "<prompt>Suggest searching for application notes for specific microcontrollers (e.g., 'STM32 I2C application note', 'ESP32 SPI examples').</prompt>"
*   "<prompt>Suggest exploring resources on specific sensor datasheets to see real-world protocol implementation details.</prompt>"
*   "<prompt>Suggest looking into higher-level protocols sometimes built on top of these physical layers (e.g., Modbus RTU over UART).</prompt>"
