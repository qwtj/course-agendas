Factoring a polynomial completely into linear factors (possibly with complex coefficients) or irreducible quadratic factors over the real numbers.

## Polynomial Functions and Their Graphs #Functions #Graphing #Analysis
Understanding polynomials as functions and visualizing them.

### Definition of a Polynomial Function #FunctionNotation #Evaluation
`P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ... + a_1 x + a_0`
Evaluating `P(c)` means substituting `c` for `x`.

### Graphs of Polynomial Functions #Visualization #Curves
Polynomial functions have smooth, continuous graphs (no sharp corners or breaks).

### End Behavior #Asymptotics #Limits
The behavior of the graph as `x` approaches positive or negative infinity (`x → ∞` or `x → -∞`).
Determined by the degree (`n`) and the sign of the leading coefficient (`a_n`).
*   Even degree, positive `a_n`: Up on both ends.
*   Even degree, negative `a_n`: Down on both ends.
*   Odd degree, positive `a_n`: Down on left, Up on right.
*   Odd degree, negative `a_n`: Up on left, Down on right.

### Zeros, Roots, and x-intercepts #Intercepts #Roots #Solutions
Values of `x` for which `P(x) = 0`. These correspond to the x-intercepts of the graph.
*   Real zeros are x-intercepts.
*   Complex zeros do not appear as x-intercepts.

### Multiplicity of Zeros #Multiplicity #GraphBehavior
The number of times a factor `(x - c)` appears in the factored form of the polynomial.
*   **Odd Multiplicity:** The graph *crosses* the x-axis at `x = c`.
*   **Even Multiplicity:** The graph *touches* the x-axis (is tangent) at `x = c` but does not cross.

### Turning Points (Local Extrema) #Extrema #PeaksValleys
Points where the graph changes direction (from increasing to decreasing or vice versa).
A polynomial of degree `n` has at most `n-1` turning points.

### Sketching Polynomial Graphs #GraphingStrategy #Visualization
Combine information about end behavior, zeros (and their multiplicities), y-intercept (`P(0)`), and turning points to sketch the graph. Test points between zeros if needed.

## Finding Roots and Zeros of Polynomials #Roots #Zeros #Theorems
Techniques and theorems for finding the values of `x` that make `P(x) = 0`.

### The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra #FundamentalTheorem #ComplexRoots
States that every non-constant polynomial `P(x)` with complex coefficients has at least one complex root.
Corollary: A polynomial of degree `n` (where `n > 0`) has exactly `n` roots (counting multiplicities) in the complex number system.

### The Rational Root Theorem (Rational Zero Theorem) #RationalRoots #PotentialZeros
Provides a list of *possible* rational roots (`p/q`) based on the factors of the constant term (`p`) and the leading coefficient (`q`).
Helps narrow down the search for rational roots.

### Descartes' Rule of Signs #SignChanges #PositiveNegativeRoots
Relates the number of sign changes in the coefficients of `P(x)` to the possible number of positive real roots.
Relates the number of sign changes in `P(-x)` to the possible number of negative real roots.

### Conjugate Root Theorems #ComplexRoots #IrrationalRoots
*   **Complex Conjugate Root Theorem:** If a polynomial `P(x)` has real coefficients and `a + bi` is a root, then its complex conjugate `a - bi` is also a root.
*   **Irrational Conjugate Root Theorem:** If a polynomial `P(x)` has rational coefficients and `a + √b` (where `√b` is irrational) is a root, then its conjugate `a - √b` is also a root.

### Finding Roots Systematically #Strategy #Process
1.  Use the degree to know the total number of roots.
2.  Use Descartes' Rule to estimate positive/negative real roots.
3.  Use the Rational Root Theorem to list possible rational roots.
4.  Test possible rational roots using Synthetic Division and the Factor/Remainder Theorems.
5.  Once a root `c` is found, use the depressed polynomial (result of division) to find remaining roots.
6.  If left with a quadratic, use factoring or the quadratic formula.
7.  Remember conjugate pairs for complex/irrational roots if coefficients are real/rational.

### Numerical Methods (Approximation) #Approximation #NumericalAnalysis
Methods like Newton-Raphson used when exact roots are difficult or impossible to find algebraically. (Often considered more advanced).

## Solving Polynomial Equations and Inequalities #Equations #Inequalities #Solutions
Finding values of the variable that satisfy polynomial equations (`P(x) = 0`) or inequalities (`P(x) > 0`, `P(x) < 0`, etc.).

### Solving Polynomial Equations #AlgebraicSolutions #FindingRoots
Equivalent to finding the roots or zeros of the corresponding polynomial function.
Use factoring, root-finding theorems, and potentially the quadratic formula on reduced polynomials.

### Solving Polynomial Inequalities #SignAnalysis #IntervalTesting
1.  Find the real zeros of the polynomial (where `P(x) = 0`). These are the boundary points.
2.  Plot these zeros on a number line, dividing it into intervals.
3.  Choose a test value within each interval and evaluate the sign of `P(x)` in that interval.
4.  Identify the intervals where the inequality is satisfied.
5.  Consider whether the boundary points themselves are included (for ≤ or ≥).

### Graphical Interpretation #Graphing #Solutions
*   Solutions to `P(x) = 0` are the x-intercepts.
*   Solutions to `P(x) > 0` are the x-values where the graph is above the x-axis.
*   Solutions to `P(x) < 0` are the x-values where the graph is below the x-axis.
