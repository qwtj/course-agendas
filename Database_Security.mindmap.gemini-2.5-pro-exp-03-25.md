# Database Security #Overview #Fundamentals
Database security encompasses the policies, controls, procedures, and technologies employed to protect database systems and the data within them from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, damage, or theft. Its core goals are ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad) of data.

## Foundational Concepts #Basics #Theory
Core principles underpinning database security practices.

### Confidentiality #Privacy #Secrecy
Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized users and processes. Preventing unauthorized disclosure. #CIA

### Integrity #Accuracy #Consistency
Maintaining the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout its lifecycle. Preventing unauthorized modification or corruption. #CIA

### Availability #Accessibility #Uptime
Ensuring authorized users can access the database and its data when needed. Preventing denial of service. #CIA

### Authentication #Identity #Verification
The process of verifying the identity of a user, process, or device attempting to access the database. #AccessControl

### Authorization #Permissions #Privileges
The process of granting or denying specific permissions to authenticated users based on their roles or attributes. #AccessControl
