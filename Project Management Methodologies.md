**I. Project Management Fundamentals**

*   Understanding Project Management
    *   Defining projects, programs, and portfolios.
    *   Identifying project constraints: Scope, Time, Cost (the "Triple Constraint").
    *   Differentiating project management from operations management.
*   Exploring Project Life Cycles
    *   Initiation: Defining project objectives and feasibility.
    *   Planning: Creating a project management plan.
        *   Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): Decomposing project deliverables into manageable tasks.
        *   Gantt Charts: Visualizing project timelines and dependencies.
        *   Critical Path Method (CPM): Identifying the longest sequence of tasks.
    *   Execution: Managing project resources and tasks.
    *   Monitoring & Controlling: Tracking progress and managing changes.
        *   Earned Value Management (EVM): Measuring project performance against the plan.
    *   Closure: Formalizing project completion and documenting lessons learned.
*   Identifying Project Stakeholders
    *   Defining stakeholders and their roles.
    *   Analyzing stakeholder influence and impact.
    *   Managing stakeholder expectations.

**II. Traditional Project Management Methodologies**

*   Understanding Waterfall Methodology
    *   Sequential, phase-based approach.
    *   Strengths: Well-defined requirements, structured process.
    *   Weaknesses: Inflexible, difficult to adapt to changes.
    *   Example: Software development with clearly defined specifications.
*   Exploring Critical Path Method (CPM)
    *   Identifying the longest sequence of activities that determines the project duration.
    *   Calculating early start, early finish, late start, and late finish times.
    *   Determining float (slack) for each activity.
    *   Using CPM software: `Microsoft Project`, `Primavera P6`.
*   Gaining Insight into PRINCE2 (Projects IN Controlled Environments)
    *   Process-based methodology with defined roles and responsibilities.
    *   Emphasis on business justification and controlled stages.
    *   Themes: Business Case, Organization, Quality, Plans, Risk, Change, Progress.
    *   Example: Government projects requiring strict governance.

**III. Agile Project Management Methodologies**

*   Understanding Agile Principles
    *   Iterative and incremental approach.
    *   Focus on customer collaboration and responding to change.
    *   The Agile Manifesto: Values and principles.
*   Exploring Scrum Framework
    *   Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
    *   Events: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.
    *   Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment.
    *   Example: Rapid software development with frequent releases.
*   Understanding Kanban Methodology
    *   Visualizing workflow with a Kanban board.
    *   Limiting work in progress (WIP).
    *   Continuous flow and improvement.
    *   Measuring lead time and cycle time.
    *   Example: Support teams or operations with continuous tasks.
*   Examining Extreme Programming (XP)
    *   Focus on code quality and customer involvement.
    *   Practices: Pair programming, test-driven development, continuous integration.
    *   Example: Small teams developing complex software systems.
*   Comparative Analysis
    *   Comparing Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban, XP).
    *   Choosing the right methodology for a specific project.

**IV. Project Management Tools and Techniques**

*   Using Project Management Software
    *   `Microsoft Project`: Planning, scheduling, resource management.
    *   `Jira`: Agile project management, issue tracking.
    *   `Asana`: Task management, collaboration.
    *   `Trello`: Kanban-style task management.
*   Applying Risk Management Techniques
    *   Identifying potential risks.
    *   Assessing the likelihood and impact of risks.
    *   Developing risk response strategies (avoid, mitigate, transfer, accept).
    *   Creating a risk register.
*   Understanding Communication Management
    *   Developing a communication plan.
    *   Identifying communication channels and frequencies.
    *   Managing communication with stakeholders.
*   Applying Quality Management Techniques
    *   Defining quality standards.
    *   Implementing quality control measures.
    *   Performing quality assurance activities.

**V. Advanced Project Management Concepts**

*   Exploring Program Management
    *   Managing multiple related projects to achieve strategic objectives.
    *   Benefits realization management.
*   Understanding Portfolio Management
    *   Selecting and prioritizing projects and programs.
    *   Aligning projects with organizational strategy.
*   Agile Scaling Frameworks
    *   SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework): Enterprise-level Agile implementation.
    *   LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum): Scaling Scrum for larger teams and projects.
*   Project Management Office (PMO)
    *   Establishing a PMO to standardize project management practices.
    *   Providing support and guidance to project managers.
*   Ethical Considerations in Project Management
    *   Adhering to ethical codes and standards.
    *   Managing conflicts of interest.
    *   Promoting transparency and accountability.
