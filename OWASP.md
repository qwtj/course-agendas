# I. Introduction to OWASP

## Understanding OWASP's Mission and Structure

### OWASP's Goals and Objectives
*   Focus on application security.
*   Community-driven, open-source initiatives.
*   Raising awareness and providing resources.

### OWASP Projects and Chapters
*   Overview of various OWASP projects (Top Ten, ZAP, ASVS, etc.).
*   Local OWASP chapter activities and involvement.

## Key Application Security Concepts

### Common Vulnerabilities
*   SQL Injection: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user' AND password = '' OR '1'='1' --'`.
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
*   Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR).
*   Security Misconfiguration.
*   Sensitive Data Exposure.

### Threat Modeling Basics
*   Identifying assets, threats, and vulnerabilities.
*   STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege).

# II. OWASP Top Ten

## Understanding the OWASP Top Ten

### Purpose and Scope
*   A ranked list of the most critical web application security risks.
*   Regular updates reflecting current attack trends and vulnerabilities.

### Accessing the OWASP Top Ten List
*   Locating the latest version on the OWASP website.

## Detailed Examination of Each Vulnerability

### A01:2021 – Broken Access Control
*   Definition: Flaws that allow users to access resources or perform actions they shouldn't.
*   Examples: IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References), Path Traversal (`../../etc/passwd`).
*   Prevention: Implementing least privilege principles, access control mechanisms.

### A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures
*   Definition: Improper use of cryptography leading to sensitive data exposure.
*   Examples: Storing passwords in plaintext, using weak encryption algorithms.
*   Prevention: Using strong and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and proper key management.

### A03:2021 – Injection
*   Definition: Injecting malicious data into an application to execute unintended commands.
*   Examples: SQL Injection, Command Injection, LDAP Injection.
*   Prevention: Input validation, parameterized queries, escaping.

### A04:2021 – Insecure Design
*   Definition: Flaws related to architectural and design weaknesses.
*   Examples: Lack of threat modeling, insufficient security controls during development.
*   Prevention: Secure development lifecycle (SDLC), threat modeling, security architecture reviews.

### A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration
*   Definition: Improper configuration of application components or the environment.
*   Examples: Default passwords, unnecessary features enabled, verbose error messages.
*   Prevention: Hardening configurations, regular security audits, automated configuration management.

### A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components
*   Definition: Using components with known vulnerabilities without patching or updating.
*   Examples: Outdated libraries, frameworks, and software.
*   Prevention: Regularly updating components, using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools.

### A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures
*   Definition: Flaws in authentication and session management that allow attackers to impersonate users.
*   Examples: Weak password policies, session fixation, predictable session IDs.
*   Prevention: Multi-factor authentication, strong password policies, secure session management.

### A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures
*   Definition: Code and infrastructure updates without integrity verification.
*   Examples: Using plugins and modules from untrusted sources.
*   Prevention: Using digital signatures to verify integrity, review code changes.

### A09:2021 – Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
*   Definition: Insufficient logging and monitoring make it difficult to detect and respond to attacks.
*   Examples: Not logging failed login attempts, insufficient alerting.
*   Prevention: Comprehensive logging, real-time monitoring, incident response plans.

### A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
*   Definition: An attacker can cause the server to make requests to unintended locations.
*   Examples: Internal network scans, reading local files, accessing internal services.
*   Prevention: Input validation of URLs, whitelisting allowed destinations, network segmentation.

# III. OWASP Tools and Resources

## OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)

### Introduction to ZAP
*   Open-source web application security scanner.
*   Used for penetration testing and vulnerability assessment.

### Setting Up and Configuring ZAP
*   Installing ZAP.
*   Configuring proxy settings.

### Using ZAP for Vulnerability Scanning
*   Automated scanning.
*   Manual exploration and spidering.
*   Active and passive scanning.

### Analyzing ZAP Reports
*   Interpreting scan results.
*   Identifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities.

## OWASP ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard)

### Understanding ASVS
*   A framework for verifying the security of web applications.
*   Provides a list of security requirements and test cases.

### Using ASVS for Security Testing
*   Mapping ASVS requirements to application features.
*   Performing security tests based on ASVS test cases.

### Integrating ASVS into the SDLC
*   Using ASVS to guide secure development practices.

## Other Useful OWASP Resources
