---
**Transition:** With table design principles covered, the focus now shifts to performing basic data operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
---

# III. Basic Data Operations (CRUD)
*   **Learning Objective:** Learn how to perform fundamental Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on DynamoDB items using the AWS SDK or CLI.
"<prompt>Explain the four basic CRUD operations in the context of DynamoDB items: PutItem (Create/Update), GetItem (Read), UpdateItem (Update), and DeleteItem (Delete). Provide examples using AWS SDK syntax (e.g., Python Boto3) or AWS CLI commands.</prompt>"

## Creating and Replacing Items (`PutItem`)
"<prompt>Describe the `PutItem` operation. Explain that it creates a new item or completely replaces an existing item with the same primary key. Provide an example using AWS CLI (`aws dynamodb put-item --table-name ...`) or Boto3 (`table.put_item(Item=...)`).</prompt>"
*   **Example:** "<prompt>Show a simple `PutItem` example using AWS CLI or Boto3 to add a new user item to a 'Users' table.</prompt>"
```bash
# AWS CLI Example
aws dynamodb put-item \
    --table-name Users \
    --item '{"UserID": {"S": "user123"}, "Email": {"S": "user@example.com"}, "SignUpDate": {"N": "1678886400"}}'
```

## Reading Items (`GetItem`)
"<prompt>Describe the `GetItem` operation for retrieving a single item based on its primary key. Explain its efficiency for direct lookups and its strongly consistent read option. Provide an example using AWS CLI (`aws dynamodb get-item --table-name ... --key ...`) or Boto3 (`table.get_item(Key=...)`).</prompt>"
*   **Example:** "<prompt>Show a simple `GetItem` example using AWS CLI or Boto3 to retrieve the user item created previously.</prompt>"

## Updating Items (`UpdateItem`)

## Deleting Items (`DeleteItem`)
"<prompt>Describe the `DeleteItem` operation for removing a single item based on its primary key. Explain conditional deletion. Provide an example using AWS CLI (`aws dynamodb delete-item --table-name ... --key ...`) or Boto3 (`table.delete_item(Key=...)`).</prompt>"
*   **Example:** "<prompt>Show a `DeleteItem` example using AWS CLI or Boto3 to remove the user item.</prompt>"

> **Key Point:** `GetItem` and operations using the full primary key are highly efficient. `UpdateItem` is versatile for modifying existing items atomically.

*   **Summary:** This section detailed the fundamental DynamoDB operations for managing individual items: `PutItem` for creating/replacing, `GetItem` for retrieving by primary key, `UpdateItem` for modifying attributes, and `DeleteItem` for removal. Conditional writes were also introduced.
*   **Glossary:**
    *   **CRUD:** Acronym for Create, Read, Update, Delete - the basic operations for persistent storage.
    *   **`PutItem`:** DynamoDB API call to create or replace an entire item.
    *   **`GetItem`:** DynamoDB API call to retrieve a single item by its primary key.

*   **Practical Task:** "<prompt>Generate a small task instructing the learner to use the AWS CLI or their preferred SDK to perform a sequence of operations: PutItem, GetItem, UpdateItem (add an attribute), GetItem (verify update), DeleteItem.</prompt>"
*   **Further Reading:** "<prompt>Provide links to the AWS documentation for `PutItem`, `GetItem`, `UpdateItem`, and `DeleteItem` API operations.</prompt>"
*   **Cross-reference:** These basic operations are the building blocks used in more complex interactions discussed in Advanced Techniques (Section VIII).

---
**Transition:** Having learned how to manage individual items, we now explore how to retrieve multiple items using Query and Scan operations.
---

# IV. Querying and Scanning Data
*   **Learning Objective:** Understand the difference between `Query` and `Scan` operations and learn how to use them effectively, including applying filters, to retrieve data from DynamoDB tables and indexes.
"<prompt>Explain the methods for retrieving multiple items from DynamoDB: `Query` and `Scan`. Detail their use cases, performance characteristics, and how to filter results using Key Condition Expressions and Filter Expressions.</prompt>"

## The `Query` Operation
"<prompt>Describe the `Query` operation for retrieving items that share the same Partition Key value. Explain that it requires specifying the partition key and can optionally include conditions on the Sort Key. Discuss its efficiency compared to `Scan`. Provide examples using AWS CLI or Boto3 (`table.query(KeyConditionExpression=...)`).</prompt>"
### Key Condition Expressions
"<prompt>Explain Key Condition Expressions used with the `Query` operation. Detail the allowed operators for the Partition Key (equality) and Sort Key (equality, comparison, `BETWEEN`, `begins_with`).</prompt>"
*   **Example:** "<prompt>Show a `Query` example using AWS CLI or Boto3 to retrieve all orders for a specific customer ID (partition key) placed within a certain date range (sort key).</prompt>"

## The `Scan` Operation
"<prompt>Describe the `Scan` operation for reading every item in a table or secondary index. Explain its potential inefficiency and cost implications for large tables. Discuss use cases where `Scan` might be appropriate (e.g., small tables, table exports) but emphasize preferring `Query` when possible. Provide examples using AWS CLI or Boto3 (`table.scan(...)`).</prompt>"
*   **Example:** "<prompt>Show a `Scan` example using AWS CLI or Boto3 to retrieve all users from the 'Users' table (cautioning about performance on large tables).</prompt>"

## Filtering Results (`FilterExpression`)
"<prompt>Explain Filter Expressions, which can be used with both `Query` and `Scan` operations. Describe how they allow filtering results based on non-key attributes *after* the data has been read but *before* it's returned to the client. Emphasize that filters do not reduce the amount of read capacity consumed by the operation (especially for `Scan`).</prompt>"
*   **Example:** "<prompt>Modify the previous `Query` example to add a `FilterExpression` that only returns orders with a status of 'Shipped'.</prompt>"
```python
# Boto3 FilterExpression Example (within a Query)
response = table.query(
    KeyConditionExpression=Key('CustomerID').eq('cust123') & Key('OrderDate').between('2023-01-01', '2023-01-31'),
    FilterExpression=Attr('Status').eq('Shipped')
)
```

## Query vs. Scan: Performance and Cost
"<prompt>Compare `Query` and `Scan` directly regarding performance and consumed read capacity. Reinforce that `Query` is generally much more efficient for targeted data retrieval, while `Scan` reads the entire table and should be used judiciously.</prompt>"

> **Key Point:** Use `Query` for efficient retrieval based on primary keys. Use `Scan` sparingly due to its potential performance impact on large tables. Filters apply *after* data is read.

*   **Summary:** This section contrasted the `Query` and `Scan` operations for retrieving multiple items. `Query` uses primary keys for efficient, targeted reads, while `Scan` reads entire tables. Key Condition Expressions (for `Query`) and Filter Expressions (for both) allow refining results.
*   **Glossary:**
    *   **`Query`:** DynamoDB API call to retrieve items based on a partition key value and optional sort key conditions.
    *   **`Scan`:** DynamoDB API call to read all items in a table or index.
    *   **Key Condition Expression:** Syntax used in `Query` to specify conditions on primary key attributes.
    *   **Filter Expression:** Syntax used in `Query` or `Scan` to filter results based on non-key attributes after reading.
    *   **Consumed Read Capacity:** Units measuring the throughput used by read operations (`GetItem`, `Query`, `Scan`).
*   **Quiz:** "<prompt>Generate 3 questions (e.g., scenario-based multiple choice) testing the understanding of when to use Query vs. Scan and the impact of Filter Expressions on read capacity.</prompt>"
*   **Reflection:** "<prompt>Generate a prompt asking the learner to think about a query they might perform in a relational database using a WHERE clause on a non-indexed column, and how that compares to using a Scan with a FilterExpression in DynamoDB.</prompt>"
*   **Further Reading:** "<prompt>Provide links to AWS documentation for 'Querying Tables in DynamoDB', 'Scanning Tables in DynamoDB', and 'Working with Queries in DynamoDB'.</prompt>"
*   **Cross-reference:** Efficient querying relies heavily on the table design and indexes covered in Section II. Performance implications are detailed further in Section VI.
