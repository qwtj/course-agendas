# I. Introduction to Containerization

## Understanding Container Concepts

### What are Containers?
*   Lightweight, standalone, executable packages of software.
*   Contain everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings.

### Virtual Machines vs. Containers
*   Discuss the differences in architecture and resource utilization.
*   VMs: Full OS virtualization (hypervisor).
*   Containers: OS-level virtualization (shared kernel).

### Benefits of Containerization
*   Portability: Run anywhere.
*   Efficiency: Less overhead than VMs.
*   Isolation: Application dependencies are isolated.
*   Scalability: Easy to scale up or down.

## Introduction to Docker

### What is Docker?
*   A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
*   Key components: Docker Engine, Docker Images, Dockerfiles, Docker Hub.

### Docker Installation and Setup
*   Installing Docker on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
*   Verifying the installation: `docker --version`.

### Basic Docker Commands
*   `docker run`: Run a container from an image. Example: `docker run hello-world`.
*   `docker ps`: List running containers.
*   `docker images`: List available images.
*   `docker stop`: Stop a running container.
*   `docker rm`: Remove a stopped container.
*   `docker pull`: Download an image from Docker Hub. Example: `docker pull ubuntu`.

# II. Working with Docker Images

## Understanding Docker Images

### What are Docker Images?
*   Read-only templates used to create containers.
*   Composed of layers.

### Creating Docker Images with Dockerfile
*   Dockerfile syntax and best practices.
*   Common instructions: `FROM`, `WORKDIR`, `COPY`, `RUN`, `CMD`, `EXPOSE`.
*   Example Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends python3 python3-pip
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
```

### Building Docker Images
*   Using the `docker build` command.
*   Example: `docker build -t my-app .`.
*   Understanding the build context.

## Managing Docker Images

### Tagging Docker Images
*   Adding tags to images: `docker tag my-app:latest my-username/my-app:v1`.

### Pushing Images to Docker Hub
*   Logging in to Docker Hub: `docker login`.
*   Pushing images: `docker push my-username/my-app:v1`.

### Removing Docker Images
*   Using the `docker rmi` command: `docker rmi my-image`.

# III. Container Orchestration Concepts

## Understanding Orchestration

### What is Container Orchestration?
*   Automated management, scheduling, and scaling of containerized applications.
*   Benefits: High availability, scalability, resource optimization.

### Key Orchestration Features
*   Scheduling: Placing containers on nodes.
*   Service Discovery: Enabling containers to find each other.
*   Scaling: Adjusting the number of container replicas.
*   Health Checks: Monitoring container health.
*   Rolling Updates: Updating applications without downtime.
*   Resource Management: Allocating resources to containers.

## Introduction to Kubernetes

### What is Kubernetes?
*   An open-source container orchestration platform.
*   Key components: Control Plane (API Server, etcd, Scheduler, Controller Manager), Worker Nodes (Kubelet, Kube-Proxy).

### Kubernetes Architecture

### Control Plane Components

### Worker Node Components
*   Illustrate the interaction between each component

# IV. Kubernetes Fundamentals

## Kubernetes Objects

### Pods
*   The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
*   Can contain one or more containers.
*   Example Pod definition (YAML):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx:latest
```

### Deployments
*   Manage the desired state of Pods.
*   Provide declarative updates.
*   Example Deployment definition (YAML):

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: nginx:latest
```

### Services
*   Expose applications running in Pods.
*   Types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer.
*   Example Service definition (YAML):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

### Namespaces
*   Organize Kubernetes resources.
*   Provide isolation.

## Interacting with Kubernetes

### Installing `kubectl`
*   Installing the Kubernetes command-line tool.
*   Configuring `kubectl` to connect to a cluster.

### Basic `kubectl` Commands
*   `kubectl get pods`: List Pods.
*   `kubectl get deployments`: List Deployments.
*   `kubectl get services`: List Services.
*   `kubectl create -f my-object.yaml`: Create a resource from a YAML file.
*   `kubectl apply -f my-object.yaml`: Apply changes to a resource.
*   `kubectl delete -f my-object.yaml`: Delete a resource.
*   `kubectl describe pod my-pod`: Get details about a Pod.
*   `kubectl logs my-pod`: View Pod logs.

# V. Advanced Kubernetes Concepts

## Configuration Management

### ConfigMaps
*   Store configuration data as key-value pairs.
*   Example ConfigMap definition (YAML):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config
data:
  MY_VAR: "my-value"
```

### Secrets
*   Store sensitive information (passwords, API keys).
*   Example Secret definition (YAML):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  PASSWORD: $(echo -n "my-password" | base64)
```

## Networking

### Ingress
*   Expose HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster.
*   Example Ingress definition (YAML):

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: my-app.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

## Scaling and Updates

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
*   Automatically scales the number of Pods in a Deployment based on CPU utilization or other metrics.

### Rolling Updates and Rollbacks
*   Updating applications without downtime.
*   Rolling back to a previous version.

## Monitoring and Logging

### Prometheus
*   Monitoring system for collecting and querying metrics.

### Grafana
*   Visualization tool for creating dashboards from Prometheus metrics.

### ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
*   Centralized logging solution for collecting, processing, and visualizing logs.
