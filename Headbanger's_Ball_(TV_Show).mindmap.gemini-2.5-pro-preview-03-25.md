Brief overview of MTV's earlier attempts at metal programming, notably "Heavy Metal Mania" hosted by Dee Snider.

### Creation and Launch #Premiere #DJJohnBrent #Founding
The show premiered on MTV on April 18, 1987. The name "Headbangers Ball" was reportedly first used by UK DJ John Brent in the early 1980s for his rock roadshows.

### Initial Format #Concept #EarlyYears
Launched as a stark contrast to the Top 40 pop videos dominating MTV's daytime programming, focusing on hard rock and heavy metal. It initially aired late on Saturday nights.

### Early Hosting #GuestHosts #KevinSeal #AdamCurry
The first episode featured guest hosts Lemmy Kilmister and Phil Taylor of Motörhead. Kevin Seal hosted briefly, followed by VJ Adam Curry (1988-1990).

## The Classic MTV Era (1987-1995) #GoldenAge #RikiRachtman #Influence
The show's most iconic period on the main MTV channel.

### Riki Rachtman Era #Host #Personality #Cathouse
Riki Rachtman became the host in 1990, suggested by his friend Axl Rose, and remained until 1995. His tenure is often considered the show's definitive period. He was also owner of the famous L.A. rock club, The Cathouse.

### Programming and Content #MusicVideos #Interviews #Segments
Featured a mix of music videos, artist interviews (in-studio and on-location), live footage, news segments, and sometimes comedic or off-the-wall content.

### Music Genres Featured #HairMetal #ThrashMetal #GlamMetal #HardRock #AlternativeMetal #Grunge
Initially focused heavily on mainstream-friendly glam metal ("hair metal") but increasingly incorporated thrash metal, alternative metal, and eventually grunge and heavier alternative rock acts as the musical landscape shifted in the late 80s and early 90s.

### Show Expansion #Hard60 #Runtime
For a period in 1988-1989, the show's runtime expanded to three hours. A daily one-hour version called "Hard 60" also aired for a time on weekday afternoons.

### Notable Segments and On-Location Shoots #Travel #UniqueContent
Featured memorable segments like bands visiting theme parks (Alice in Chains at Action Park), bowling (Soundgarden), or covering major events like the Moscow Music Peace Festival (1989).

### Cancellation #Decline #Grunge #AlternativeRock #Superock
Canceled abruptly in 1995. Reasons cited include the rise of grunge and alternative rock shifting MTV's focus away from traditional metal, and the show's content becoming less distinct from daytime programming. Rachtman was informed via phone call not to come back. It was briefly replaced by "Superock". The cancellation is often cited by critics as a key moment in MTV's move away from music programming.

### Scheduling and Decline #ErraticAiring #Cancellation
