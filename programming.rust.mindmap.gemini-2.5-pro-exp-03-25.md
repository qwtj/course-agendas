### Structs #CustomTypes #Fields #Methods #DataOrganization
Defining custom data structures using `struct`.
#### Defining Structs #struct #NamedFields #TupleStructs #UnitLikeStructs
Different ways to define structs: classic C-style structs with named fields, tuple structs (named tuples), and unit-like structs (no fields).
#### Implementing Methods #impl #AssociatedFunctions #self #Self
Attaching behavior to structs using `impl` blocks, distinguishing between methods (taking `&self`, `&mut self`, or `self`) and associated functions (like static methods).

#### Defining Traits #MethodSignatures #AssociatedTypes
Specifying a set of method signatures or associated types that implementing types must provide.
#### Implementing Traits #GenericImplementations #BlanketImplementations #OrphanRule
Providing concrete implementations of trait methods for specific types (`impl MyTrait for MyType`). Can be generic (`impl<T> MyTrait for Vec<T>`) or conditional. Blanket implementations (`impl<T: Display> ToString for T`). Orphan rule restricts implementations.
#### Trait Bounds #ConstrainingGenerics #where #Syntax

## Memory Management Details #MemorySafety #Performance #LowLevel
Deeper dive into how Rust manages memory, building on the ownership system.
### Stack vs Heap #Allocation #MemoryLayout #PerformanceTradeoffs
Understanding where data is stored (fast stack allocation vs. flexible heap allocation) and the implications.
### RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) #Destructors #DropTrait #ResourceManagement
A common pattern where resource lifetimes (memory, file handles, network sockets) are bound to the lifetime of objects. Cleanup happens automatically when the object goes out of scope via the `Drop` trait.
### Interior Mutability #RefCell #Cell #RuntimeChecks #SharedMutability
A pattern allowing mutation of data even through immutable references, using types like `Cell<T>` (for `Copy` types) and `RefCell<T>` (enforces borrowing rules at runtime). Used within single-threaded contexts typically.
### Reference Counting (`Rc<T>` and `Arc<T>`) #SharedOwnership #Cycles #MemoryLeaks
Mechanisms for multiple parts of a program to share ownership of data. `Rc<T>` is for single-threaded scenarios, `Arc<T>` (Atomic RC) is thread-safe. Need to be careful about reference cycles, which can lead to memory leaks. Often used with `RefCell` or `Mutex` for mutability.

## Modules, Crates, and Packages #CodeOrganization #ProjectStructure #Namespacing #Encapsulation
How Rust code is organized into logical units and distributed.
### Packages and Crates #CargoToml #Library #Binary #CompilationUnit
A package contains one or more crates and a `Cargo.toml` manifest. A crate is a compilation unit, either a library or a binary executable.
### Modules System #mod #use #pub #Privacy #Hierarchy
Organizing code within a crate using modules (`mod`) to control scope, privacy (public `pub` vs. private default), and hierarchy.
### Paths for Referring to Items #AbsolutePaths #RelativePaths #super #`self`
How to refer to items (functions, structs, etc.) defined in other modules using paths (e.g., `crate::module::item`, `super::item`, `self::item`).
### Bringing Paths into Scope (`use`) #Idioms #Renaming #`as`
Using the `use` keyword to bring items into the current scope, reducing path verbosity. Common idioms and renaming with `as`.
### Separating Modules into Files #FileHierarchy #`mod.rs` #DirectoryStructure

### Testing Private Functions #TestingInternals #Visibility
Strategies for testing internal implementation details (usually by testing the public API that uses them, or conditionally compiling test modules).
### Test Setup and Teardown #Fixtures #SharedState (Challenges)
Discussing patterns for setting up common state for tests (no built-in fixtures like some frameworks, often requires manual setup/teardown or external crates).

## Smart Pointers #MemoryManagement #OwnershipPatterns #WrapperTypes
Types that act like pointers but also have additional metadata and capabilities, crucial for patterns like RAII and shared ownership.
### `Box<T>` (Heap Allocation) #UniqueOwnership #SizedTypes #Indirection
The simplest smart pointer, providing heap allocation for a value and unique ownership. Useful for recursive types or large data transfer.
### `Deref` Trait #DereferenceCoercion #PointerBehavior #OperatorOverloading
Allows customizing the behavior of the dereference operator (`*`). Enables deref coercion (e.g., `&String` to `&str`).
### `Drop` Trait #CustomCleanup #RAII #ResourceRelease
Allows customizing code that runs when a value goes out of scope, enabling RAII.
### `Rc<T>` (Reference Counting) #SingleThreaded #SharedOwnership #NonAtomic
Smart pointer for sharing ownership of heap-allocated data within a single thread. Keeps track of reference counts.
### `Arc<T>` (Atomic Reference Counting) #MultiThreaded #ThreadSafe #AtomicOperations
A thread-safe version of `Rc<T>` using atomic operations for reference counting, suitable for sharing ownership across threads.
### `RefCell<T>` and `Cell<T>` #InteriorMutability #RuntimeBorrowChecking #SingleThreadedMutation
Used in conjunction with `Rc<T>` (or other contexts) to allow mutation of data even when it's immutably borrowed (enforces rules at runtime for `RefCell`, requires `Copy` types or getter/setter methods for `Cell`).

## Concurrency and Parallelism #Multithreading #Performance #Safety
Leveraging multiple threads or cores for simultaneous execution, with Rust's safety guarantees.
### Fearless Concurrency #CompileTimeSafety #DataRaces #Send #Sync

### Threads #`std::thread` #spawn #join #ExecutionUnits
Creating and managing OS threads using the standard library (`thread::spawn`, `thread::JoinHandle`).
### Message Passing #Channels #mpsc #Communication #Decoupling
Communicating between threads by sending messages through channels (`std::sync::mpsc` - multiple producer, single consumer). Promotes loose coupling.
### Shared State Concurrency #Mutex #RwLock #Sync #Send #Locking
Allowing multiple threads to access the same data using synchronization primitives like Mutexes (mutual exclusion) and Read-Write locks. Requires careful handling to avoid deadlocks.
#### `Mutex<T>` #MutualExclusion #Locking #Poisoning
Ensures only one thread can access the data inside at a time. Rust's mutexes handle poisoning on panic.
#### `RwLock<T>` #ReadWriteLocks #MultipleReaders #SingleWriter
Allows multiple readers or a single writer to access data, potentially offering better performance for read-heavy workloads.
#### `Sync` and `Send` Traits #ThreadSafetyMarkers #CompilerChecks
Marker traits indicating whether types are safe to transfer (`Send`) or share (`Sync`) across threads. Automatically implemented for many types; crucial for compiler safety checks.
### Parallel Iterators (Rayon crate) #DataParallelism #EasyParallelization #WorkStealing

### Async Runtimes (e.g., Tokio, async-std) #Executors #TaskScheduling #IO #Reactors
Libraries that provide the necessary components to run async code: an executor to poll Futures, task scheduler, and often non-blocking I/O facilities (reactor).
### Async Ecosystem #Networking #WebFrameworks #Databases #Libraries
The growing ecosystem of crates built on async/await for tasks like web servers (Actix, Axum, Rocket), database clients, and general networking.
### Pinning #`std::pin` #SelfReferentialStructs #MemorySafety #AsyncInternals
A mechanism (`Pin<P>`) required for safely handling self-referential types, which are common in async code generated by the compiler. Ensures objects don't move in memory while borrowed internally.

## Unsafe Rust #LowLevel #FFI #PerformanceOptimization #BypassSafety
A subset of Rust where some compiler guarantees are disabled, requiring manual upholding of safety invariants. Used for specific low-level tasks.
### `unsafe` Keyword and Blocks #Superpowers #Responsibility #OptIn
The keyword used to delimit sections of code where unsafe operations are permitted. The programmer takes responsibility for memory safety within these blocks.
### Dereferencing Raw Pointers #`*const T` #`*mut T` #MemorySafetyRisks #UndefinedBehavior
Working with C-like raw pointers, which lack Rust's borrowing rules and lifetime guarantees. Dereferencing them is an unsafe operation.
### Calling Unsafe Functions or Methods #ExternalCode #LowLevelOps #HardwareInteraction
Functions marked `unsafe fn` (often FFI functions or low-level intrinsics) require an `unsafe` block to call.
### Accessing or Modifying Static Variables #MutableStatics #DataRaces #ThreadSafety
Reading or writing `static mut` variables is unsafe due to potential data races if accessed from multiple threads without synchronization.
### Implementing Unsafe Traits #ManualSafetyGuarantees #`Sync` #`Send`
Implementing traits like `Send` or `Sync` manually if the compiler cannot verify safety requires the `unsafe impl` syntax.
### Interfacing with External Code (FFI) #SeeNextSection #PrimaryUse
One of the main reasons for using `unsafe` Rust is to interact with code written in other languages (like C).

## FFI (Foreign Function Interface) #Interoperability #CLibraries #Bindings #ABI
Mechanisms for calling code written in other languages (typically C) from Rust, and vice-versa.
### Calling C Code from Rust #`extern "C"` #Linking #ABICompatibility
Using `extern "C"` blocks to declare the signatures of C functions and linking against C libraries. Requires `unsafe` blocks to call these functions.
### Calling Rust Code from Other Languages #`#[no_mangle]` #`extern "C"` #LibraryCrates #CDylib
Exposing Rust functions with a C-compatible ABI using `extern "C" fn` and `#[no_mangle]
` attribute so they can be called from C or other languages. Typically involves compiling Rust code as a static or dynamic library.
### Safe Abstractions over Unsafe FFI #WrapperTypes #API Design #Encapsulation
