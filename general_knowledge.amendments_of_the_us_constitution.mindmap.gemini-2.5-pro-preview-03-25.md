Defines the formal methods for altering the Constitution.

### Proposal Methods #Congress #NationalConvention #ArticleV
How amendments are officially suggested.

Requires a convention called for by two-thirds of the State legislatures.
This method has never been used to propose an amendment.

### Ratification Methods #States #Legislatures #Conventions #ArticleV
How proposed amendments are approved and become part of the Constitution.

#### Ratification by State Legislatures #StateGovernment #ThreeFourthsVote

This is the most common method of ratification.

This method was used only once, for the 21st Amendment (repealing Prohibition).
