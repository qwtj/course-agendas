# I. Understanding Primary Colors

*(Learning Objective: Define primary colors and identify the standard primary colors in additive and subtractive color models.)*

## Defining Primary Colors
"<prompt>Explain the concept of primary colors in color theory. Define what makes a color 'primary' and why they are fundamental. Specify the context is foundational color theory concerning Primary and Secondary Colors.</prompt>"

## Identifying Subtractive Primary Colors (Pigment)
"<prompt>List and describe the traditional subtractive primary colors used in pigments (like paint and ink), focusing on Red, Yellow, and Blue (RYB model). Explain why these specific colors are considered primary in this model within the context of learning about Primary and Secondary Colors.</prompt>"
*   ### Example: Red
    "<prompt>Provide a concise description of the primary color Red within the RYB pigment model, emphasizing its inability to be created by mixing other pigments.</prompt>"
*   ### Example: Yellow
    "<prompt>Provide a concise description of the primary color Yellow within the RYB pigment model, emphasizing its inability to be created by mixing other pigments.</prompt>"
*   ### Example: Blue
    "<prompt>Provide a concise description of the primary color Blue within the RYB pigment model, emphasizing its inability to be created by mixing other pigments.</prompt>"

## Identifying Additive Primary Colors (Light)
"<prompt>List and describe the additive primary colors used in light (like screens and digital displays), focusing on Red, Green, and Blue (RGB model). Briefly explain why this model differs from the subtractive pigment model, in the context of understanding different types of Primary Colors.</prompt>"
*   ### Example: Red (Light)
    "<prompt>Provide a concise description of the primary color Red within the RGB light model.</prompt>"

> **Key Point:** Primary colors are the foundation; they cannot be created by mixing other colors within their respective color model (subtractive/pigment vs. additive/light).

*Section I Summary: This section defined primary colors as the fundamental colors that cannot be created by mixing others. We identified the subtractive primaries (Red, Yellow, Blue for pigment) and additive primaries (Red, Green, Blue for light).*

*(Self-Assessment: Include a short quiz here asking to identify primary colors and differentiate between additive and subtractive models.)*

# II. Understanding Secondary Colors

*(Learning Objective: Define secondary colors and explain how they are derived from mixing primary colors in both subtractive and additive models.)*

## Defining Secondary Colors
"<prompt>Explain the concept of secondary colors in color theory. Define how secondary colors are created, referencing their relationship to primary colors within the context of foundational color theory.</prompt>"

## Deriving Subtractive Secondary Colors (Pigment)
"<prompt>Explain how secondary colors are created by mixing pairs of subtractive primary colors (Red, Yellow, Blue). List the resulting secondary colors (Orange, Green, Violet).</prompt>"
*   ### Mixing Red and Yellow
    "<prompt>Describe the result of mixing the primary pigments Red and Yellow, identifying the resulting secondary color (Orange).</prompt>"
    *   Example: `Red + Yellow = Orange`
*   ### Mixing Yellow and Blue
    "<prompt>Describe the result of mixing the primary pigments Yellow and Blue, identifying the resulting secondary color (Green).</prompt>"
    *   Example: `Yellow + Blue = Green`
*   ### Mixing Blue and Red
    "<prompt>Describe the result of mixing the primary pigments Blue and Red, identifying the resulting secondary color (Violet/Purple).</prompt>"
    *   Example: `Blue + Red = Violet`

## Deriving Additive Secondary Colors (Light)
"<prompt>Explain how secondary colors are created by mixing pairs of additive primary colors (Red, Green, Blue). List the resulting secondary colors (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow).</prompt>"
*   ### Mixing Red and Green Light
    "<prompt>Describe the result of mixing the primary lights Red and Green, identifying the resulting secondary color (Yellow light).</prompt>"
    *   Example: `Red Light + Green Light = Yellow Light`
*   ### Mixing Green and Blue Light
    "<prompt>Describe the result of mixing the primary lights Green and Blue, identifying the resulting secondary color (Cyan light).</prompt>"
    *   Example: `Green Light + Blue Light = Cyan Light`
*   ### Mixing Blue and Red Light
    "<prompt>Describe the result of mixing the primary lights Blue and Red, identifying the resulting secondary color (Magenta light).</prompt>"
    *   Example: `Blue Light + Red Light = Magenta Light`

> **Key Point:** Secondary colors are always the result of mixing two primary colors within the *same* color model. Notice how the secondary colors of light (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) are related to the *primary* colors used in printing ink (CMYK model, a subtractive model closely related to RYB). (Cross-reference: Section I - Primary Colors).

*Section II Summary: This section defined secondary colors as those created by mixing two primary colors. We explored the specific outcomes of mixing primary pigments (Orange, Green, Violet) and primary lights (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow).*

*(Self-Assessment: Include a short quiz here asking how secondary colors are made and identifying the results of specific primary color mixes.)*

*   ### Achieving True Secondary Colors
    "<prompt>Explain potential challenges when mixing primary pigments (e.g., getting muddy colors) and suggest techniques to achieve brighter, clearer secondary hues like Orange, Green, and Violet.</prompt>"
    *   Example: "<prompt>Generate a brief instruction on starting with the lighter primary color (e.g., yellow) and gradually adding the darker primary (e.g., blue) when mixing to achieve a specific secondary hue (e.g., green).</prompt>"

## Relationship Between Additive and Subtractive Models
"<prompt>Briefly explain the inverse relationship often observed between the primary colors of one model and the secondary colors of the other (e.g., RGB primaries vs. CMY secondaries, and RYB primaries vs. theoretical light mixing if viewed differently), reinforcing the understanding of both systems covered in Sections I and II.</prompt>" (Cross-reference: Section I, Section II)

> **Key Point:** The color wheel is a fundamental tool for visualizing relationships between primary and secondary colors and predicting mixing outcomes.

*Section III Summary: This section introduced the basic color wheel as a tool for organizing primary and secondary colors and discussed practical tips for mixing pigments to achieve secondary colors. The relationship between additive and subtractive models was revisited.*
