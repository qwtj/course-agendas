# Content Security Policy (CSP) #WebSecurity #BrowserSecurity #Mitigation
Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security standard introduced to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other code injection attacks resulting from execution of malicious content in the trusted web page context.

## Fundamentals of CSP #Basics #Concepts #Introduction
Understanding the core purpose and principles behind CSP.

### What is CSP? #Definition #Purpose
CSP provides a standard method for website owners to declare approved origins of content that browsers should be allowed to load for that websiteâ€”covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

### Why Use CSP? #Motivation #ThreatModel #Benefits
Primary motivation is mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and certain data injection attacks.
It acts as a defense-in-depth mechanism.

### How CSP Works #Mechanism #Process
Browser receives the CSP policy (via HTTP header or meta tag).
Browser enforces the policy by blocking resources/actions that violate it.
Violations can be optionally reported back to a specified URI.

### Goals of CSP #Objectives #SecurityGoals
Prevent execution of untrusted scripts.
Prevent loading of untrusted resources.
Prevent unwanted framing.
Prevent form submissions to unexpected destinations.
Mitigate data exfiltration.

## CSP Directives #Syntax #Rules #Configuration
The core components of a CSP policy, defining the rules for resource loading and execution.

### Fetch Directives #Resources #Loading #Network
Control locations from which certain resource types may be loaded.
#### `default-src` #Fallback #DefaultPolicy
Defines the default policy for most fetch directives if they are not explicitly specified.
#### `script-src` #JavaScript #Scripts #Execution
Specifies valid sources for JavaScript `<script>` elements.
#### `style-src` #CSS #Stylesheets #Styling
Specifies valid sources for stylesheets (`<link>`, `<style>`, `style` attributes).
#### `img-src` #Images #Media
Specifies valid sources for images (`<img>`, favicons).
#### `font-src` #Fonts #Typography
Specifies valid sources for fonts loaded using `@font-face`.
#### `connect-src` #XHR #FetchAPI #WebSockets
Restricts URLs which can be loaded using script interfaces like `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `WebSocket`, `EventSource`.
#### `media-src` #Audio #Video #Media
Specifies valid sources for loading media using `<audio>` and `<video>`.
#### `object-src` #Plugins #Objects #Embeds
Specifies valid sources for `<object>`, `<embed>`, and `<applet>` elements. Often recommended to set to `'none'`.
#### `prefetch-src` #Prefetching #Performance
Specifies valid sources for prefetching or prerendering.
#### `child-src` #WebWorkers #Frames #Obsolete
Defines valid sources for web workers and nested browsing contexts loaded using elements such as `<frame>` and `<iframe>`. Deprecated in favor of `worker-src` and `frame-src`.
#### `frame-src` #Frames #Iframes #Embedding
Specifies valid sources for nested browsing contexts loaded into `<frame>` and `<iframe>`.
#### `worker-src` #WebWorkers #ServiceWorkers #Concurrency
Specifies valid sources for `Worker`, `SharedWorker`, or `ServiceWorker` scripts.

### Document Directives #DocumentPolicy #Environment
Govern the properties of a document or worker environment.
#### `base-uri` #BaseTag #RelativeURLs
Restricts the URLs which can be used in a document's `<base>` element. Helps prevent base tag hijacking.
#### `plugin-types` #Plugins #MIME #Obsolete
Restricts the set of plugins that can be invoked by limiting the types of resources that can be embedded. Deprecated.
#### `sandbox` #Sandboxing #IframeSecurity #Restrictions
Applies restrictions similar to the `sandbox` attribute on an `<iframe>`. Enables a sandbox for the requested resource.

### Navigation Directives #Navigation #FormSubmission #Framing
Govern to where a user can navigate or submit a form.
#### `form-action` #Forms #Submission #POST
Restricts the URLs which can be used as the target of form submissions from a given context.
#### `frame-ancestors` #Framing #Clickjacking #Embedding
Specifies valid parents that may embed a page using `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, or `<applet>`. Crucial for preventing clickjacking. Supersedes the `X-Frame-Options` header.
#### `navigate-to` #Navigation #Experimental
Restricts the URLs to which a document can initiate navigation by any means (not widely supported yet).

### Reporting Directives #Violations #Monitoring #Feedback
Control the reporting process of CSP violations.
#### `report-uri` #ReportingEndpoint #JSON #Legacy
Specifies a URI where the browser should send reports about policy violations. Deprecated in favor of `report-to`.
#### `report-to` #ReportingAPI #JSON #Modern
Specifies a group name defined in the `Report-To` HTTP header. Enables use of the Reporting API for more flexible reporting.

### Special Source Values #Keywords #Permissions
Keywords that modify how directives behave.
#### `'self'` #SameOrigin
Refers to the origin from which the protected document is being served, including the same URL scheme and port number.
#### `'none'` #Block #Deny
Blocks use of sources of the specified type.
#### `'unsafe-inline'` #InlineCode #Risk #Avoid
Allows the use of inline resources, such as inline `<script>` elements, `javascript:` URLs, inline event handlers, and inline `<style>` elements. Generally discouraged.
#### `'unsafe-eval'` #Eval #DynamicCode #Risk #Avoid
Allows the use of `eval()` and similar methods for creating code from strings. Generally discouraged.
#### `'unsafe-hashes'` #InlineHandlers #LegacyCompatibility
Allows enabling specific inline event handlers. Requires specifying allowed hashes.
#### `nonce-{base64-value}` #NonceBased #InlineCode #Security
Allows a specific inline script or style block identified by a cryptographic nonce (number used once). The nonce must be unique per request.
#### `sha256-{base64-value}`, `sha384-...`, `sha512-...` #HashBased #InlineCode #Security
Allows a specific inline script or style block identified by its hash.
#### `strict-dynamic` #Propagation #NonceBased #HashBased #Modern
Allows the execution of scripts dynamically added to the page by an already trusted script (via nonce or hash), regardless of the source. Simplifies deployment with frameworks.
#### `host-source` #Domain #URL #Wildcard
Specifies hosts by domain name or IP address (e.g., `example.com`, `*.example.com`, `https://example.com`).
#### `scheme-source` #Protocol #Scheme
Specifies schemes (e.g., `https:`, `data:`, `blob:`).
#### `report-sample` #ViolationDetail #Reporting
Instructs the browser to include a sample of the violating code in the violation report (applies to `script-src` and `style-src`).

### Other Directives #Miscellaneous #SecurityEnhancements
#### `upgrade-insecure-requests` #HTTPS #MixedContent #AutoUpgrade
Instructs user agents to treat all of a site's insecure URLs (those served over HTTP) as though they have been replaced with secure URLs (those served over HTTPS).
#### `block-all-mixed-content` #HTTPS #MixedContent #Strict
Prevents loading any assets using HTTP when the page is loaded using HTTPS. More strict than `upgrade-insecure-requests`.
#### `require-sri-for` #SubresourceIntegrity #SRI #Validation
Requires the use of Subresource Integrity (SRI) for scripts or styles on the page. Values: `script`, `style`.
#### `require-trusted-types-for` #TrustedTypes #DOMXSS #Experimental
Requires Trusted Types for DOM manipulation sinks (e.g., `script`). Helps prevent DOM-based XSS.
#### `trusted-types` #TrustedTypes #DOMXSS #Configuration #Experimental
Used to specify policies for Trusted Types enforcement.

## Implementation and Deployment #Configuration #Setup #Adoption
Practical steps and considerations for putting CSP into effect.

### Delivery Methods #Headers #MetaTags
How the policy is sent from the server to the browser.
#### HTTP Header (`Content-Security-Policy`) #Recommended #ServerSide
The standard and recommended method. Set by the web server or application.
#### HTTP Header (`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`) #Monitoring #Testing #Audit
Instructs the browser to report violations but not enforce the policy. Used for testing and refinement before full enforcement.
#### HTML Meta Tag (`<meta http-equiv="...">`) #Limited #ClientSide
Can be used within the HTML document itself. Less flexible and has limitations (e.g., cannot use `frame-ancestors`, `report-uri`, `sandbox`).

### Deployment Strategy #Rollout #Process
Phased approach to introducing CSP.
#### 1. Auditing #Inventory #Assessment
Identify all necessary resources (scripts, styles, images, fonts, connections, frames).
#### 2. Policy Generation #Drafting #Tools
Create an initial policy based on the audit. Online generators can help.
#### 3. Report-Only Mode #Testing #Refinement
Deploy using `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header. Monitor violation reports.
#### 4. Policy Refinement #Iteration #Adjustments
Adjust the policy based on reports, fixing legitimate issues and tightening rules.
#### 5. Enforcement Mode #Live #Protection
Switch to the `Content-Security-Policy` header once confident the policy is correct.
#### 6. Ongoing Monitoring #Maintenance #Updates
Continuously monitor reports and update the policy as the application evolves.

### Handling Inline Code #Refactoring #SecurityTechniques
Strategies for dealing with `unsafe-inline`.
#### Nonce-Based Approach #DynamicNonce #ServerSideLogic
Generate a unique nonce per request, add it to the CSP header (`script-src 'nonce-...'`), and add `nonce="..."` attributes to allowed `<script>`/`<style>` tags. Requires server-side logic.
#### Hash-Based Approach #StaticContent #BuildProcess
Calculate the hash of allowed inline scripts/styles, add them to the CSP header (`script-src 'sha256-...'`). Suitable for static inline code. Can be automated in build processes.
#### Refactoring Code #BestPractice #SeparationOfConcerns
Move inline scripts and styles to external files. This is often the cleanest solution.
#### Using `strict-dynamic` #ModernBrowsers #ScriptLoading
Simplifies nonce/hash deployment by allowing trusted scripts to load other scripts.

### Server-Side Configuration #WebServer #ApplicationFramework
Examples of setting the header in common environments.
#### Nginx #WebServerConfig
Using `add_header Content-Security-Policy "...";`
#### Apache #WebServerConfig #htaccess
Using `Header set Content-Security-Policy "...";`
#### Application Level #BackendCode #Frameworks
Setting headers via application code (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django, PHP).

## CSP Reporting #Monitoring #Violations #FeedbackLoop
Understanding and utilizing violation reports sent by browsers.

### Report Structure (JSON) #DataFormat #Schema
Details included in a violation report.
Key fields: `document-uri`, `referrer`, `violated-directive`, `effective-directive`, `original-policy`, `blocked-uri`, `source-file`, `line-number`, `column-number`, `status-code`, `script-sample` (if enabled).

### Reporting Endpoints #Collection #Aggregation
Where reports are sent and how they are processed.
#### `report-uri` (Legacy) #SimplePOST #Deprecated
Sends a simple JSON POST request to the specified URI.
#### `report-to` (Reporting API) #Modern #Flexible #Batched
Uses the newer Reporting API, allowing more configuration (e.g., grouping, priorities) via the `Report-To` header. Reports might be batched.

### Processing Reports #Analysis #Alerting #Tools
Handling the potentially large volume of reports.
#### Aggregation Services #SaaS #ThirdPartyTools
Using dedicated services (e.g., report-uri.com, Sentry) to collect, aggregate, and analyze reports.
#### Custom Solutions #InHouse #Logging
Building an in-house endpoint and processing logic.
#### Filtering Noise #FalsePositives #BrowserExtensions
Ignoring irrelevant reports caused by browser extensions, proxies, or scanners.

## Common CSP Patterns and Best Practices #Recommendations #SecurityLevels #StrictCSP

### Strict CSP #Recommended #NonceBased #HashBased #Modern
A highly recommended approach focusing on nonces or hashes.
Typically includes `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'self'`, and `script-src`/`style-src` based on nonces/hashes plus `strict-dynamic`. Avoids broad whitelists.

### Allowing `unsafe-inline` / `unsafe-eval` #Risks #Tradeoffs #Legacy
Should be avoided whenever possible due to significantly weakening security. Sometimes a temporary measure during migration.

### Whitelisting Domains #Maintenance #Permissive
Allowing specific domains (e.g., `script-src 'self' https://cdn.example.com`). Can be brittle and requires careful management. Less secure than nonce/hash approaches if overly broad wildcards are used.

### Using `'none'` #Blocking #MaximumSecurity
Setting directives like `object-src 'none'` or `frame-ancestors 'none'` for maximum restriction where applicable.

### Leveraging `strict-dynamic` #Frameworks #ScriptLoaders
Essential for making nonce/hash-based policies practical with modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries that dynamically load scripts.

### Gradual Rollout #PhasedApproach #ReportOnly
Using `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` extensively before enforcement.

## CSP Bypasses and Limitations #Weaknesses #AttackVectors #Evasion

### Overly Permissive Policies #Wildcards #UnsafeKeywords
Using `*` or broad wildcards (`*.example.com`), or allowing `unsafe-inline` / `unsafe-eval` can negate CSP's benefits.

### Misconfigured Server #HeaderIssues #CDN
Incorrect header syntax, issues with CDNs caching policies incorrectly, or proxies stripping headers.

### Dangling Markup Injection #HTMLInjection #DataExfiltration
Injecting partial HTML tags that capture data and send it to an attacker-controlled server allowed by `img-src` or `connect-src`.

### JSONP Endpoints #CallbackAbuse #DataLeak
If a whitelisted domain hosts a JSONP endpoint, it might be abused to bypass `script-src` restrictions.

### External Script Dependencies #TrustedScripts #Vulnerabilities
Trusting third-party scripts means trusting their security. A compromised CDN or third-party script can bypass CSP.

### Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) #ServerSideVulnerability
If an attacker can control server-side templates, they might inject nonces or modify the CSP header itself.

### Bypasses via `object-src` / `embed` / `applet` #PluginAbuse #LegacyRisk
If `object-src` allows vulnerable plugins (like Flash in the past) or broad sources. Best set to `'none'`.

### Browser Bugs / Inconsistencies #ImplementationErrors #EdgeCases
Rarely, bugs in browser implementations can lead to bypasses.

### Non-Mitigated Threats #LimitationsScope
CSP primarily targets XSS and some data injection/exfiltration. It does *not* directly mitigate CSRF, server-side flaws (SQLi, RCE), authentication issues etc., although it can sometimes limit their impact.

## Advanced Topics and Related Technologies #Future #Integrations #Ecosystem

### Trusted Types #DOMXSS #Prevention #API
A newer mechanism enforced via CSP (`require-trusted-types-for`, `trusted-types`). Aims to prevent DOM XSS by requiring potentially dangerous DOM sink functions (like `innerHTML`) to receive special `TrustedType` objects instead of strings. Requires code refactoring.

### CSP for Single Page Applications (SPAs) #Frameworks #Routing #Challenges
Handling dynamic content loading, client-side routing, and template rendering within CSP constraints, often relying heavily on `strict-dynamic`.

### CSP in Service Workers #BackgroundScripts #SecurityContext
Defining and enforcing CSP for Service Worker scripts (`Service-Worker-Allowed` header interaction).

### CSP and WebAssembly (Wasm) #BinaryCode #Execution #`unsafe-eval`
WebAssembly execution often requires `'unsafe-eval'` unless specific mechanisms are used. Work is ongoing to improve this interaction.

### Subresource Integrity (SRI) #IntegrityCheck #CDN #Hashing
Ensures that fetched resources (typically from CDNs) are delivered without unexpected manipulation by providing hashes (`integrity="..."` attribute). Complements CSP. Can be enforced using `require-sri-for`.

### Reporting API #ModernReporting #FlexibleEndpoints #`Report-To`
A broader browser mechanism for sending various reports (CSP, NEL, Deprecation, Intervention, Crashes) specified via the `Report-To` HTTP header.

### Relationship to other Security Headers #DefenseInDepth #HTTPHeaders
How CSP interacts with or complements other security headers.
#### `X-Frame-Options` #Clickjacking #Legacy
Superseded by `frame-ancestors`. CSP provides more flexibility.
#### `Referrer-Policy` #Privacy #DataLeakage
Controls how much referrer information is sent.
#### `Permissions-Policy` (Feature-Policy) #FeatureControl #APIControl
Controls access to browser features and APIs (camera, geolocation, etc.).
#### `HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)` #HTTPS #Encryption
Enforces HTTPS connections. Complements `upgrade-insecure-requests`.
