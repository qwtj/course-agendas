# St Thomas Aquinas #Theologian #Philosopher #Scholasticism
Central figure in medieval philosophy and theology, known for synthesizing Aristotelian philosophy with Christian doctrine. Doctor of the Church (Doctor Angelicus, Doctor Communis).

## Life and Historical Context #Biography #History #DominicanOrder
Aquinas lived during a pivotal period of intellectual and cultural development in High Medieval Europe.
### Early Life and Education #Childhood #MonteCassino #Naples

### Joining the Dominican Order #Vocation #FamilyOpposition #AlbertusMagnus
Joined the Dominican Order around 1244 against his family's wishes. Studied under Albertus Magnus (Albert the Great) in Paris and Cologne.
### Academic Career #University #Teaching #Paris #Cologne #Italy
Taught theology at the University of Paris, Cologne, and various locations in Italy (Rome, Orvieto, Viterbo, Naples). Engaged in major academic debates.
### Major Controversies #Averroism #MendicantControversy #Debate
Contended with Radical Aristotelians (often labeled "Latin Averroists") regarding the interpretation of Aristotle, particularly on the soul's immortality and the world's eternity. Defended the mendicant orders' place within the university.
### Later Life and Death #MysticalExperience #CouncilOfLyon #Death
Experienced a significant mystical event near the end of his life (1273), after which he ceased writing. Died in 1274 at Fossanova Abbey while travelling to the Second Council of Lyon.
### Historical Context #13thCentury #Universities #Scholasticism #MendicantOrders
Lived during the flourishing of scholasticism, the rise of universities (Paris, Oxford, Bologna), and the establishment of mendicant orders (Dominicans, Franciscans). This era saw the influx of Aristotelian texts into Western Europe.

## Philosophical Foundations #Philosophy #Influences #Aristotle
Aquinas integrated insights from various philosophical traditions into his own framework.
### Aristotle's Influence #Aristotelianism #Metaphysics #Ethics #Logic #Integration
The most significant philosophical influence. Adopted and adapted Aristotle's metaphysics (act/potency, hylomorphism, four causes), epistemology, ethics (virtue ethics), logic, and political thought.
#### Adaptation of Aristotelianism #ChristianFramework #Synthesis #Reinterpretation
Reinterpreted Aristotle within a Christian theological context, resolving apparent conflicts (e.g., eternity of the world vs. creation ex nihilo).
### Neoplatonic Influences #Neoplatonism #Augustine #PseudoDionysius #Hierarchy
Influenced by Neoplatonic concepts, often mediated through St. Augustine and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, such as the hierarchy of being, participation, and divine illumination (though adapted).
### Islamic and Jewish Philosophy #Avicenna #Averroes #Maimonides #Dialogue
Engaged critically with prominent Islamic philosophers (Avicenna, Averroes) and the Jewish thinker Maimonides, particularly concerning Aristotelian interpretations and the relationship between faith and reason.
### Relationship with Prior Christian Thought #Patristics #Augustine #Boethius #Anselm
Built upon the foundations laid by earlier Christian thinkers like Augustine (grace, will, evil), Boethius (person, eternity), and Anselm (proofs for God's existence, though Aquinas preferred a posteriori arguments).

## Major Writings #Works #Theology #Philosophy
A prolific writer whose works cover theology, philosophy, biblical commentary, and disputations.
### Summa Theologiae #Masterpiece #SystematicTheology #Structure #Unfinished
His magnum opus, a systematic exposition of theology structured in a question-and-answer format (quaestio method). Intended as an instructional guide for theology students. Left unfinished.
#### Prima Pars (First Part) #God #Creation #Angels #Man
Covers God's existence and attributes, the Trinity, creation, angels, and human nature (soul, intellect, will).
#### Secunda Pars (Second Part) #Ethics #Virtues #Law #Grace
Deals with human action and morality. Divided into two sub-parts:
##### Prima Secundae (I-II) #GeneralEthics #Happiness #HumanActs #Passions #Virtues #Law #Grace
General principles of morality: the ultimate end (happiness/beatific vision), human acts, passions, virtues and vices, law (eternal, natural, human, divine), and grace.
##### Secunda Secundae (II-II) #SpecificVirtues #TheologicalVirtues #CardinalVirtues #Sins
Specific virtues (theological: faith, hope, charity; cardinal: prudence, justice, fortitude, temperance) and their corresponding vices/sins. Also discusses states of life.
#### Tertia Pars (Third Part) #Christ #Sacraments #Eschatology
Covers the person and work of Christ (Incarnation, life, Passion) and the Sacraments. The section on Penance, Extreme Unction, Orders, and Matrimony, and the very end (Eschatology) were completed by disciples based on earlier writings (Supplementum).
### Summa Contra Gentiles #Apologetics #MissionaryWork #ReasonAndFaith #Gentiles
(Book on the Truth of the Catholic Faith Against the Errors of the Unbelievers) An apologetic work aimed at demonstrating the reasonableness of Christian faith, often addressing arguments from non-Christian philosophers, likely intended for missionaries.
### Disputed Questions (Quaestiones Disputatae) #AcademicDebates #SpecificTopics #InDepth
Transcripts of formal academic debates (disputations) on specific theological and philosophical topics, offering in-depth analysis (e.g., De Veritate (On Truth), De Potentia (On Power), De Malo (On Evil), De Anima (On the Soul)).
### Commentaries #Aristotle #Scripture #Boethius #Lombard #Interpretation
Extensive commentaries on Aristotle's major works, books of the Bible (e.g., Job, Psalms, Gospels, Pauline Epistles), Peter Lombard's Sentences, Boethius, and Pseudo-Dionysius.
### Shorter Works and Treatises #Opuscula #SpecificIssues #Summaries
Numerous shorter works (opuscula) on specific topics, such as *De Ente et Essentia* (On Being and Essence), *De Regno* (On Kingship), *Compendium Theologiae*.

## Metaphysics #Being #Existence #Essence #Reality
Aquinas's foundational understanding of reality.
### Act and Potency (Actus et Potentia) #AristotelianConcepts #Change #Motion #Potentiality
Fundamental principles explaining change and stability. Potency is the potential to be or become; Act is the realization of that potential. God is understood as Pure Act (Actus Purus), having no potentiality.
### Essence and Existence (Essentia et Esse) #RealDistinction #Contingency #GodAsPureAct
A core doctrine: in all created beings, there is a real distinction between what a thing is (its essence) and that it is (its existence). Only in God are essence and existence identical. Explains the contingency of creatures.
### Hylomorphism #MatterAndForm #Substance #Accidents #Constitution
Aristotelian theory that physical substances are composed of prime matter (pure potentiality) and substantial form (what makes a thing what it is). Accidents are modifications of a substance.
### Analogy of Being #Language #GodTalk #Analogy
Theory explaining how terms (like 'good' or 'wise') can be applied meaningfully to both God and creatures. Avoids univocity (meaning exactly the same) and equivocity (meaning completely different), proposing analogy (meaning proportionally similar).
### Participation #NeoplatonicConcept #HierarchyOfBeing #RelationToGod #Perfection
Creatures possess perfections (like being, goodness, truth) by participating in God, who is the source and fullness of these perfections. Establishes a hierarchy of being based on degrees of participation.
### Causality #FourCauses #FirstCause #Dependency
Employs Aristotle's four causes (material, formal, efficient, final) to explain reality. Argues for the necessity of a First Uncaused Cause (God) for the existence of the chain of caused beings.

## Epistemology and Philosophy of Mind #Knowledge #Reason #Soul #Intellect
Aquinas's theory of knowledge and the nature of the human mind/soul.
### Theory of Knowledge #Empiricism #Abstraction #Intellect #Senses
Knowledge begins with sense experience. The intellect abstracts universal concepts (forms/natures) from the particular data provided by the senses (phantasms) through the action of the agent intellect (intellectus agens).
### Faith and Reason #Harmony #DistinctDomains #Handmaiden #Truth
Faith and reason are two distinct but harmonious paths to truth, both ultimately originating from God. Reason can discover some truths about God (preambles of faith), while others require divine revelation (mysteries of faith). Philosophy serves as a "handmaiden" to theology.
### Philosophy of Mind #SoulAsForm #Intellect #Will #Immortality
The rational soul is the substantial form of the human body (hylomorphism). Key faculties are the intellect (knowledge) and the will (desire/choice). Argues for the incorruptibility and immortality of the individual human soul based on its immaterial operations (understanding universals).

## Natural Theology #God #Reason #Proof #Existence
Knowledge of God attainable through human reason alone, without divine revelation.
### The Existence of God #FiveWays #QuinqueViae #Proofs #Arguments #Posteriori
Aquinas's famous five arguments (Quinque Viae) for God's existence presented in the Summa Theologiae. These are a posteriori arguments, starting from observations about the natural world.
#### Argument from Motion (Unmoved Mover) #PrimaVia #Change
Things are in motion (change); whatever is moved is moved by another; this chain cannot regress infinitely; therefore, there must be a First Unmoved Mover (God).
#### Argument from Efficient Cause (First Cause) #SecundaVia #Causation
There is an order of efficient causes; nothing can be the efficient cause of itself; the chain of causes cannot regress infinitely; therefore, there must be a First Efficient Cause (God).
#### Argument from Possibility and Necessity (Contingency) #TertiaVia #Being
We observe contingent beings (that can exist or not exist); if everything were contingent, eventually nothing would exist, which is false; therefore, there must be a Necessary Being whose necessity comes from itself (God).
#### Argument from Gradation of Being (Perfection) #QuartaVia #Degrees
There are degrees of perfection (goodness, truth, nobility) in beings; these degrees imply the existence of a maximum perfection which is the cause of all lesser perfections (God).
#### Argument from Design (Governance of the World) #QuintaVia #Teleology #Order
Natural bodies act towards ends, even non-intelligent ones; this purposeful behavior implies guidance by an intelligent being; therefore, there must be an Intelligent Designer who directs all natural things to their end (God).
### Divine Attributes #Simplicity #Perfection #Goodness #Infinity #Immutability #Omniscience #Omnipotence
Reason can deduce certain attributes of God based on His status as First Cause and Pure Act: simplicity (no parts), perfection, goodness, infinity, immutability (unchangeableness), eternity, unity, omniscience, omnipotence.

## Theology Proper (Revealed Theology) #Revelation #Dogma #Trinity #Creation
Doctrines known primarily through divine revelation (Scripture and Tradition).
### Doctrine of God #OneGod #DivineNature #Essence
Expands on the nature of the One God known through reason, incorporating revealed truths about His inner life and actions.
### The Trinity #OneEssenceThreePersons #Relations #Processions #DivinePersons
The central Christian mystery: God is one divine essence (substance/nature) existing as three distinct Persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit), distinguished by their relations of origin (processions).
### Creation #ExNihilo #DivineAction #Providence #Conservation #FreeWill
God created the universe freely out of nothing (ex nihilo). God not only creates but also conserves all things in being and guides them through divine providence, respecting creaturely freedom.
### Angels #Angelology #Nature #Hierarchy #Knowledge #Will
Purely spiritual, incorporeal created beings with intellect and will, existing in a hierarchy. Discusses their nature, knowledge, and role in creation.
### Problem of Evil #Theodicy #PermissionOfEvil #GreaterGood #FreeWill
Addresses the challenge of evil's existence in a world created by an all-good, all-powerful God. Argues God permits evil (moral and physical) for the sake of a greater good (e.g., creaturely freedom, virtues like patience and fortitude).

## Christology #JesusChrist #Incarnation #Salvation #Redemption
The study of the person and work of Jesus Christ.
### The Incarnation #HypostaticUnion #OnePersonTwoNatures #CommunicationOfIdioms
The doctrine that the eternal Son of God (the Word) assumed a human nature. Jesus Christ is one divine Person with two complete natures (divine and human), united without confusion, change, division, or separation (Hypostatic Union). This allows for the "communication of idioms" (attributing properties of one nature to the Person).
### Life and Ministry of Christ #RedemptiveWork #Miracles #Teaching
Examines the events of Jesus's life, teachings, and miracles as revealing God and accomplishing salvation.
### Passion, Death, and Resurrection #Atonement #SatisfactionTheory #Salvation #Victory
Christ's suffering, death, and resurrection are the central events of salvation. Aquinas emphasizes the *satisfaction* theory of atonement: Christ's sacrifice meritoriously satisfied the demands of divine justice offended by sin, reconciling humanity to God.

## Sacramental Theology #Sacraments #Grace #Church #Liturgy
The study of the Christian sacraments as channels of divine grace.
### Nature of Sacraments #Signs #CausesOfGrace #MatterAndForm #Efficacy
Sacraments are outward signs instituted by Christ that cause the grace they signify (ex opere operato – by the work worked). Analyzes them in terms of matter (physical element/action) and form (words).
### The Seven Sacraments #Baptism #Eucharist #Confirmation #Penance #Anointing #Orders #Matrimony
Detailed theological treatment of the seven sacraments recognized by the Catholic Church.
### Eucharist #Transubstantiation #RealPresence #Sacrifice
Central focus on the Eucharist. Defends the doctrine of Transubstantiation: the substance of the bread and wine is changed into the substance of the Body and Blood of Christ, while the accidents (appearances) remain. Affirms the Real Presence of Christ and the sacrificial nature of the Mass.

## Ethics #Virtue #NaturalLaw #Happiness #Morality
Aquinas's moral philosophy, blending Aristotelian eudaimonism with Christian theology.
### Ultimate End (Telos) #Happiness #BeatificVision #Eudaimonia #Goal
The ultimate goal (telos) of human life is happiness (beatitudo). Imperfect happiness is achievable through virtue in this life, but perfect happiness consists in the Beatific Vision (direct contemplation of God) in the next life.
### Virtue Ethics #Habits #IntellectualVirtues #MoralVirtues #Cardinal #Theological
Focuses on character development through acquiring virtues (stable dispositions to act well). Distinguishes intellectual virtues (perfecting the intellect) and moral virtues (perfecting the appetites according to reason). Key virtues are the four cardinal virtues (prudence, justice, fortitude, temperance) and the three theological virtues (faith, hope, charity - infused by grace).
### Natural Law #Participation #EternalLaw #Precepts #HumanReason #Morality
Humans participate in God's eternal law (divine wisdom governing creation) through natural law – the innate capacity of human reason to discern basic moral principles (e.g., "do good and avoid evil," preserve life, seek truth, live in society). Forms the foundation for objective morality.
### Human Acts #VoluntaryAction #Freedom #Intention #Circumstances #Object
Analyzes the structure of moral action: requires knowledge and consent (voluntariness). Morality depends on the object (the act itself), the intention (the motive/goal), and the circumstances.
### Passions (Emotions) #RoleInMoralLife #ControlByReason #Integration
Emotions (passions) are natural responses of the sensitive appetite. They are morally neutral in themselves but become good or evil depending on whether they conform to reason and are well-ordered towards the good.
### Sin #NatureOfSin #MortalVsVenial #OriginalSin #Vice
An act contrary to reason and God's law. Distinguishes mortal sin (destroys charity, causes loss of sanctifying grace) and venial sin (weakens charity). Discusses original sin and the development of vices (bad habits).
### Grace #NecessityOfGrace #TypesOfGrace #Justification #Supernatural
Divine assistance necessary to achieve the supernatural end (Beatific Vision) and often needed even to consistently perform natural good. Distinguishes various types (e.g., actual, sanctifying). Justification is the process by which a sinner is made righteous through God's grace.

## Political and Legal Philosophy #Politics #Law #Society #Justice
Aquinas's thought on governance, law, and the organization of society.
### Nature and Purpose of Law #OrdinanceOfReason #CommonGood #Authority #Promulgation
Defines law as "an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated." Law aims at directing human acts towards the common good.
### Types of Law #EternalLaw #NaturalLaw #HumanLaw #DivineLaw #Hierarchy
A hierarchy of interrelated laws:
*   **Eternal Law:** God's rational plan governing all creation.
*   **Natural Law:** Human participation in the eternal law through reason.
*   **Human Law:** Specific applications of natural law enacted by legitimate authority for particular communities. Must conform to natural law to be just.
*   **Divine Law:** Law revealed by God (e.g., Old and New Testaments) guiding humanity to its supernatural end.
### State and Government #CommonGood #JustRule #FormsOfGovernment #Tyranny #Authority
The state is a natural institution necessary for human flourishing and achieving the common good. Discusses different forms of government (monarchy, aristocracy, polity) and their corruptions (tyranny, oligarchy, democracy/mob rule). Favors a mixed regime, often leaning towards monarchy guided by law. Defines conditions under which tyranny might be resisted.
### Church and State #Relationship #DistinctSpheres #SpiritualSupremacy #TwoSwords
Both Church and State are necessary societies with distinct ends (spiritual and temporal welfare). Argues for cooperation between them, but ultimately asserts the superiority of the spiritual authority (Church) over the temporal (State) in matters pertaining to salvation.
### Justice and Rights #JustWar #Property #SocialOrder
Discusses principles of justice (distributive, commutative) and lays foundations for natural rights derived from natural law. Formulates criteria for a Just War (jus ad bellum, jus in bello).

### Contemporary Interpretations #AnalyticalThomism #ExistentialThomism #LublinThomism #RiverForest
Diverse modern interpretations and applications, including Analytical Thomism (e.g., Eleonore Stump, John Haldane), Existential Thomism (Maritain, Gilson - focusing on existence), Transcendental Thomism (Karl Rahner, Bernard Lonergan - dialogue with Kant), Lublin Thomism (Karol Wojtyla/John Paul II - focusing on the person).
### Relevance Today #Ethics #PoliticalThought #ScienceDialogue #Interfaith #Bioethics
Aquinas's ideas continue to be invoked in contemporary discussions on ethics (natural law, virtue ethics, bioethics), political philosophy (common good, justice, law), the dialogue between faith and science, and interfaith dialogue.
