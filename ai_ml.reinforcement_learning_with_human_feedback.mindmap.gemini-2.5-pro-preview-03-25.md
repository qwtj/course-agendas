# Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)   #RLHF #AIAlignment #MachineLearning
RLHF is a machine learning technique used to align AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), with human preferences and values by incorporating human feedback into the reinforcement learning process. [1][4][5][6]

## Introduction to RLHF #Overview #Motivation
Explanation of the core concept: Using human feedback to train AI models, especially when desired behaviors are complex, nuanced, or hard to specify algorithmically (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty). [3][5][10][18]
### Why RLHF? #ProblemDefinition #AlignmentGoal
Limitations of traditional RL reward functions for complex, human-centric tasks. [1][3][6] Need for models to understand and adhere to human preferences, values, and safety considerations. [4][8][20][28] Bridge the gap between AI capabilities and human alignment. [8][18]
### Core Idea #HighLevel #Concept
Train a "reward model" that learns human preferences from feedback, then use this model to guide the fine-tuning of a policy model (e.g., an LLM) using RL. [1][3][4][24]
### Historical Context #Origins #Development
Early applications in robotics and game playing (Atari, Dota 2, StarCraft). [1][3][6] Transition to NLP and LLMs (InstructGPT, ChatGPT, Claude). [2][3][5][6][10] Emergence as a key technique for post-training LLMs. [6]

Overview of relevant RL approaches (e.g., policy gradients, Q-learning). [1][17]
### Challenges in Traditional RL #Limitations #RewardDesign
Difficulty in designing reward functions that perfectly capture desired complex behaviors. [1][3][6]

## Background: Large Language Models #LLMs #Pretraining
Understanding the base models typically fine-tuned with RLHF. [6]
### Transformer Architecture #NeuralNetworks #SelfAttention
Core architecture enabling modern LLMs.
### Pretraining Objectives #Foundation #UnsupervisedLearning
Training on vast text corpora (e.g., next-word prediction). [19] Establishes foundational language understanding. [1]
### Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) #InstructionFollowing #InitialTuning
Initial fine-tuning on high-quality instruction-response datasets (demonstration data) before RLHF. [3][9][10][22] Primes the model for expected response formats. [3] Often considered the first step in the broader RLHF process. [2][6][9][10][33]

## The Complete RLHF Pipeline #Workflow #Integration
Describes the typical multi-stage process. [2][6][9][10]
### Step 1: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) #InitialTraining #BehaviorCloning
Fine-tuning a pre-trained base model on a dataset of high-quality prompt-response pairs created by humans. [3][9][10][22][33]
Purpose: Adapts the model to follow instructions or dialogue formats. [6][9]
### Step 2: Reward Model (RM) Training #PreferenceLearning #Scoring
Training a separate model (often initialized from the SFT model) to predict human preferences. [1][2][3][4][9][17]
Input: A prompt and two or more model-generated responses. [2][5][14]
Output: A scalar score representing the degree of preference. [2][3][4][14]
Training Data: Human comparisons/rankings of model responses. [1][4][5]
Loss Function: Typically uses a ranking loss to ensure preferred responses get higher scores. [14][17]
### Step 3: RL Fine-tuning (Policy Optimization) #Optimization #PolicyLearning
Fine-tuning the SFT model (now the policy model) using RL, with rewards provided by the trained Reward Model. [1][2][3][10][17]
Goal: Maximize the reward score from the RM while staying relatively close to the original SFT model's distribution. [1]
Algorithm: Often uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). [1][2][9][17][25]
KL Divergence Penalty: A constraint added to the reward function to prevent the policy from deviating too drastically from the SFT model, maintaining response diversity and coherence. [1][2]
### Iterative Refinement (Optional) #ContinuousImprovement #Loop
Optionally, the reward model and policy can be updated iteratively, collecting more feedback on the newly trained policy. [2]

Ranking Data: Humans rank multiple responses from best to worst. [1][2]
Scalar Ratings: Humans assign a numerical score to a response. [7][13][15][24]
Direct Feedback/Edits: Humans directly suggest improvements. [7][20]
### Data Annotation Process #Labeling #Workflow
