# I. Foundations of Algebra

## Understanding Variables and Expressions

### Defining Variables
*   Letters representing unknown values (e.g., `x`, `y`, `z`).
*   Constants: Fixed numerical values (e.g., `2`, `π`).

### Constructing Algebraic Expressions
*   Combining variables and constants with operations (+, -, *, /).
*   Examples: `3x + 5`, `y^2 - 2y + 1`, `(a + b) / c`.

## Operations with Real Numbers

### Reviewing Number Systems
*   Natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, irrational numbers, real numbers.

### Performing Arithmetic Operations
*   Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of real numbers.
*   Order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).
    *   Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction.

### Understanding Properties of Real Numbers
*   Commutative, associative, distributive, identity, and inverse properties.

# II. Solving Equations and Inequalities

## Solving Linear Equations

### Understanding Linear Equations
*   Equations involving variables raised to the power of 1.
*   Standard form: `ax + b = c`.

### Applying Inverse Operations
*   Isolating the variable by performing opposite operations (addition/subtraction, multiplication/division).
*   Example: Solve `2x + 3 = 7`.
    *   Subtract 3 from both sides: `2x = 4`.
    *   Divide both sides by 2: `x = 2`.

### Solving Multi-Step Equations
*   Combining like terms, distributing, and then using inverse operations.
*   Example: `3(x - 2) + 5 = 14`.

## Solving Linear Inequalities

### Understanding Linear Inequalities
*   Using inequality symbols: `<`, `>`, `≤`, `≥`.

### Applying Properties of Inequalities
*   Adding or subtracting the same value from both sides.
*   Multiplying or dividing by a positive number: inequality remains the same.
*   Multiplying or dividing by a negative number: inequality reverses.
*   Example: Solve `-2x < 6`.
    *   Divide both sides by -2 (and reverse the inequality): `x > -3`.
