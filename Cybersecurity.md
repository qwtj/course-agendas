# I. Fundamentals of Cybersecurity

## Understanding Core Concepts

### Defining Cybersecurity
*   CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
*   Common Threats: Malware, Phishing, DDoS, Social Engineering

### Identifying Vulnerabilities
*   Weaknesses in Software, Hardware, and Human Behavior
*   Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

## Security Principles and Best Practices

### Least Privilege Principle
*   Granting only necessary access rights
*   Example: User accounts with restricted permissions

### Defense in Depth
*   Implementing multiple layers of security controls
*   Example: Firewall, intrusion detection system, antivirus software

### Security by Design
*   Integrating security from the initial stages of development
*   Example: Secure coding practices

# II. Network Security

## Network Architecture and Protocols

### TCP/IP Model
*   Understanding the layers: Application, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical
*   Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMTP, SSH

### Network Segmentation
*   Dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments
*   VLANs (Virtual LANs), Firewalls

### Wireless Security
*   Wi-Fi Security Protocols: WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3
*   Securing Access Points and Wireless Clients

## Network Security Devices

### Firewalls
*   Packet filtering, stateful inspection, next-generation firewalls (NGFW)
*   Configuration and rule management

### Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
*   Signature-based, anomaly-based, and behavior-based detection
*   Alerting and blocking malicious traffic

### VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)
*   Encryption and tunneling protocols: IPSec, SSL/TLS, WireGuard
*   Remote access and site-to-site VPN configurations

# III. Application Security

## Secure Coding Practices

### Input Validation
*   Preventing injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS)
*   Sanitizing user inputs

### Authentication and Authorization
*   Secure password storage (hashing, salting)
*   Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

### Session Management
*   Secure session IDs and timeouts
*   Preventing session hijacking

## Web Application Security

### Common Web Vulnerabilities
*   OWASP Top 10: Injection, Broken Authentication, Sensitive Data Exposure, etc.
*   Understanding and mitigating each vulnerability

### Web Security Tools
*   Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP
*   Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing

## Mobile Application Security

### Mobile Security Risks
*   Data leakage, insecure storage, malware
*   Permissions and sandboxing

### Mobile Security Best Practices
*   Secure coding for mobile platforms (iOS, Android)
*   Mobile device management (MDM)

# IV. Cryptography

## Symmetric-Key Cryptography

### Encryption Algorithms
*   AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard)
*   Block cipher modes: ECB, CBC, CTR

### Key Management
*   Secure key generation, storage, and distribution
*   Key exchange protocols

## Asymmetric-Key Cryptography

### Encryption Algorithms
*   RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
*   Digital signatures and certificates

### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
*   Certificate authorities (CAs), digital certificates
*   X.509 standard

## Hashing Algorithms

### Hash Functions
*   SHA-256, SHA-3, MD5
*   Applications: Password storage, data integrity

### Message Authentication Codes (MACs)
*   HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)
*   Ensuring message integrity and authenticity

# V. Incident Response and Forensics

## Incident Response Lifecycle

### Preparation
*   Developing an incident response plan
*   Training and awareness

### Detection and Analysis
*   Identifying and analyzing security incidents
*   Log analysis, SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

### Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
*   Isolating affected systems, removing malware, restoring services
*   Backups and disaster recovery

### Post-Incident Activity
*   Root cause analysis, lessons learned
*   Updating security policies and procedures

## Digital Forensics

### Data Acquisition
*   Imaging hard drives, memory forensics
*   Tools: `dd`, EnCase, FTK

### Evidence Analysis
*   Analyzing file systems, logs, and network traffic
*   Timeline creation

### Reporting
*   Documenting findings and presenting evidence
*   Legal and ethical considerations

# VI. Security Governance and Compliance

## Security Policies and Procedures

### Policy Development
*   Creating security policies for access control, data protection, etc.
*   Examples: Password policy, acceptable use policy

### Policy Enforcement
*   Implementing technical and administrative controls
*   Monitoring compliance

## Risk Management

### Risk Assessment
*   Identifying and evaluating risks
*   Qualitative and quantitative risk analysis

### Risk Mitigation
*   Implementing controls to reduce risk
*   Risk transfer, acceptance, avoidance

## Compliance Standards and Regulations

### Industry Standards
*   ISO 27001, NIST Cybersecurity Framework
*   Understanding requirements and implementation

### Legal and Regulatory Compliance
*   HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
*   Privacy and data protection requirements
