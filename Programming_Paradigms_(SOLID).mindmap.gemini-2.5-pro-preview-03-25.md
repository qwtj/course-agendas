# Programming Paradigms (SOLID) #SoftwareDesign #Principles #OOP
This mind map outlines the SOLID principles, a cornerstone of object-oriented design, promoting maintainable, scalable, and robust software.

## Introduction to SOLID Principles #Overview #Fundamentals #History
Provides context, defines the acronym, and explains the overall goal of SOLID.
Introduces Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) as the originator/popularizer.

### What are SOLID Principles? #Definition #Concept
A mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

### Goal of SOLID #Purpose #Benefit #Maintainability
To reduce dependencies so that engineers change one area of software without impacting others. Decreasing complexity, improving readability, and enabling agility.

### Origin and History #RobertCMartin #UncleBob #Evolution
Coined by Michael Feathers based on principles promoted by Robert C. Martin in the early 2000s, particularly in his book "Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices".

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Context #OOP #Foundation #Prerequisites
Discusses how SOLID principles are fundamentally tied to object-oriented concepts.

### Relation to OOP Pillars #Encapsulation #Inheritance #Polymorphism #Abstraction
How SOLID principles leverage and refine the core concepts of OOP.

### Class Design #Classes #Objects #Responsibilities
Focuses on designing effective classes and managing their responsibilities, a core theme in SOLID.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) #SRP #Cohesion #DesignPrinciple
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

### Definition and Goal #Responsibility #Change #Focus
Explains the core idea: isolating responsibilities to minimize the impact of changes.

### Identifying Responsibilities #Analysis #Decomposition #Actors
Techniques for determining the "single responsibility" â€“ often related to the actors or users interacting with the system.

### Common Violations #CodeSmells #AntiPatterns #GodClass
Examples like God Classes, classes mixing concerns (e.g., business logic with persistence or presentation).

### Benefits of SRP #Maintainability #Testability #Readability
Easier to understand, test, and modify classes with focused roles. Reduced coupling.

### Examples #CodeExamples #Illustrations
Concrete code snippets (conceptual or language-specific) demonstrating SRP adherence and violation.

### Related Concepts #Cohesion #SeparationOfConcerns
How SRP relates to the broader concepts of high cohesion and separation of concerns.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP) #OCP #Extensibility #DesignPrinciple
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### Definition and Goal #Extension #Modification #Flexibility
Allowing new functionality to be added with minimal changes to existing code.

### Achieving OCP #Abstraction #Polymorphism #Interfaces #Inheritance
Using techniques like abstract classes, interfaces, inheritance, and composition (e.g., Strategy pattern, Template Method pattern).

### Common Violations #CodeSmells #AntiPatterns #ModificationRequired
Situations requiring changes to existing, tested code to add new features (e.g., large switch statements based on type).

### Benefits of OCP #Maintainability #Scalability #Stability
Reduces the risk of introducing bugs into existing functionality when adding new features. Promotes reusable components.

### Examples #CodeExamples #Illustrations #StrategyPattern #TemplateMethod
Demonstrations using patterns like Strategy or Template Method to achieve OCP.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) #LSP #Inheritance #Polymorphism #DesignPrinciple
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

### Definition and Goal #Substitutability #Contracts #Behavior
Ensuring that derived classes honor the contract defined by their base classes.

### Importance of Behavioral Subtyping #Contracts #Preconditions #Postconditions #Invariants
Focuses not just on syntactic compatibility (method signatures) but semantic/behavioral compatibility.

### Common Violations #CodeSmells #AntiPatterns #SubTypeSurprises
Derived classes throwing unexpected exceptions, overriding methods to do nothing, or violating base class invariants/postconditions.

### Benefits of LSP #Reliability #Polymorphism #CodeCorrectness
Ensures that polymorphism works as expected, leading to more reliable and predictable systems. Simplifies client code.

### Examples #CodeExamples #Illustrations #SquareRectangleProblem
Classic examples like the Rectangle/Square problem demonstrating LSP violations and correct approaches.

### Testing for LSP #UnitTesting #ContractTesting
How to verify LSP adherence through testing.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) #ISP #Interfaces #Decoupling #DesignPrinciple
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces they do not use. Prefer specific client interfaces over one general-purpose interface.

### Definition and Goal #ClientSpecific #Cohesion #FatInterfaces
Avoiding "fat" interfaces that force implementing classes to implement methods they don't need. Promoting cohesive interfaces.

### Identifying Interface Pollution #Analysis #Dependencies #UnusedMethods
Recognizing when classes depend on interface methods they never use or implement them meaninglessly (e.g., throwing exceptions).

### Common Violations #CodeSmells #AntiPatterns #InterfaceBloat
Large interfaces covering multiple distinct roles or responsibilities.

### Benefits of ISP #Decoupling #Flexibility #Maintainability #CompileTimeDependencies
Reduces coupling between classes. Changes to an interface affect fewer clients/implementers. Easier refactoring.

### Examples #CodeExamples #Illustrations #RoleInterfaces
Demonstrating the splitting of large interfaces into smaller, role-specific ones.

### Relationship to SRP #Cohesion #Interfaces
How ISP applies the concept of single responsibility to interfaces.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) #DIP #Decoupling #Abstraction #DesignPrinciple
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces). Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.

### Definition and Goal #InversionOfControl #IoC #Flexibility #LooseCoupling
Inverting the traditional dependency flow where high-level components directly use low-level ones. Promoting dependency on interfaces/abstract classes.

### Abstractions vs. Details #Interfaces #AbstractClasses #ConcreteClasses
Clarifying the difference between abstractions (what something does) and details (how it does it).

### Common Violations #CodeSmells #AntiPatterns #ConcreteDependencies #NewKeyword
Direct instantiation (`new`) of low-level components within high-level components. Depending directly on concrete classes rather than interfaces.

### Benefits of DIP #Testability #Flexibility #Extensibility #Pluggability
Makes systems easier to test (using mocks/stubs), allows swapping implementations, reduces ripple effects of changes.

### Examples #CodeExamples #Illustrations #DependencyInjection
Showing how DIP is often implemented using Dependency Injection (DI) frameworks or manual injection.

### Relationship to OCP and LSP #Synergy #DesignPrinciples
How DIP facilitates adherence to OCP and relies on LSP for correct substitution of implementations.
