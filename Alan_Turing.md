# I. Foundations of Computing and Logic

## Understanding Turing's Early Life and Influences

### Biographical Overview

Details of Alan Turing's birth, education, and early interest in mathematics and science.

### Influential Figures and Works

Study the impact of figures like Einstein and works on mathematical logic on Turing's intellectual development.

## Exploring Mathematical Logic

### Propositional Logic

Understanding basic logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, IMPLIES) and truth tables.

### Predicate Logic

Introduction to quantifiers (∀, ∃) and predicate symbols.

### Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems

Brief overview of the implications of Gödel's work for the limits of formal systems.

## Introduction to Computability Theory

### Defining Algorithms

Understanding the concept of an algorithm as a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem.

### Formal Languages

Learn about formal languages and their role in describing computations.

### The Halting Problem

Understanding the problem of determining whether a given program will halt or run forever.

# II. The Turing Machine

## Defining the Turing Machine Model

### Components of a Turing Machine

Understanding the tape, head, states, and transition function.

### Formal Definition

Formalize the Turing Machine as a 7-tuple: (Q, Γ, b, Σ, δ, q0, F)

### Turing Machine Example

Design a Turing Machine that recognizes the language {0^n1^n | n >= 1}.

```
# Transition function example (simplified)
δ(q0, 0) = (q1, 0, R) # State q0, read 0, go to state q1, write 0, move right
```
