# I. Introduction to Skin Disorders

## Understanding Skin Anatomy and Physiology

### Layers of the Skin
*   Epidermis: Outermost layer, composed of keratinocytes.
*   Dermis: Contains collagen, elastin, blood vessels, and nerve endings.
*   Hypodermis: Subcutaneous fat layer, provides insulation and cushioning.

### Skin Functions
*   Protection: Barrier against pathogens, UV radiation, and mechanical injury.
*   Thermoregulation: Sweat glands and blood vessel dilation/constriction.
*   Sensation: Nerve endings for touch, pain, temperature, and pressure.
*   Vitamin D Synthesis: Conversion of precursors into Vitamin D.

## Basic Terminology in Dermatology

### Lesion Morphology
*   Macule: Flat, distinct, discolored area of skin, less than 1 cm wide (e.g., freckle).
*   Papule: Elevated, solid lesion, less than 1 cm wide (e.g., mole, wart).
*   Plaque: Elevated, flat-topped lesion, greater than 1 cm wide (e.g., psoriasis).
*   Vesicle: Fluid-filled sac, less than 1 cm wide (e.g., chickenpox, herpes).
*   Bulla: Fluid-filled sac, greater than 1 cm wide (e.g., blister).
*   Pustule: Pus-filled lesion (e.g., acne).

### Descriptive Terms
*   Erythema: Redness of the skin.
*   Pruritus: Itching.
*   Scale: Flaky skin.
*   Crust: Dried serum, pus, or blood.

# II. Common Skin Infections

## Bacterial Infections

### Impetigo
*   Definition: Superficial skin infection caused by *Staphylococcus aureus* or *Streptococcus pyogenes*.
*   Clinical Presentation: Honey-colored crusts, often around the nose and mouth.
*   Treatment: Topical or oral antibiotics (e.g., mupirocin, cephalexin).

### Cellulitis
*   Definition: Deep infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue.
*   Etiology: Usually *Streptococcus* or *Staphylococcus* species.
*   Symptoms: Redness, swelling, pain, warmth.
*   Treatment: Oral or intravenous antibiotics (e.g., cephalexin, clindamycin).

### Folliculitis
* Definition: Inflammation of the hair follicles.
* Etiology: Often *Staphylococcus aureus*.
* Symptoms: Small, red bumps or pustules around hair follicles.
* Treatment: Topical antibiotics (e.g., clindamycin) or antiseptic washes.

## Fungal Infections

### Tinea Infections (Ringworm)
*   Types: Tinea pedis (athlete's foot), tinea cruris (jock itch), tinea corporis (body ringworm), tinea capitis (scalp ringworm).
*   Etiology: Dermatophyte fungi (e.g., *Trichophyton*, *Microsporum*, *Epidermophyton*).
*   Diagnosis: KOH examination, fungal culture.
*   Treatment: Topical or oral antifungals (e.g., clotrimazole, terbinafine, griseofulvin).

### Candidiasis
*   Etiology: *Candida albicans*.
*   Common Sites: Oral mucosa (thrush), skin folds, vaginal area.
*   Symptoms: Redness, itching, white plaques (in oral thrush).
*   Treatment: Topical or oral antifungals (e.g., nystatin, fluconazole).

## Viral Infections

### Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)
*   Types: HSV-1 (oral herpes), HSV-2 (genital herpes).
*   Symptoms: Painful vesicles on an erythematous base.
*   Treatment: Antiviral medications (e.g., acyclovir, valacyclovir).

### Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV)
*   Chickenpox (Varicella): Widespread vesicular rash.
*   Shingles (Herpes Zoster): Reactivation of VZV, causing painful vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution.
*   Treatment: Antiviral medications (e.g., acyclovir, valacyclovir).

### Warts (Verrucae)
*   Etiology: Human papillomavirus (HPV).
*   Types: Common warts, plantar warts, genital warts.
*   Treatment: Topical salicylic acid, cryotherapy, surgical excision.

# III. Inflammatory Skin Conditions

## Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis)

### Pathophysiology
*   Immune dysregulation, skin barrier dysfunction.

### Clinical Presentation
*   Pruritus, dry skin, erythematous patches, lichenification (thickened skin).
*   Distribution: Infants (face, scalp, extensor surfaces), older children and adults (flexural areas).

### Management
*   Emollients, topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, phototherapy, systemic immunosuppressants.

## Psoriasis

### Pathophysiology
*   T-cell mediated autoimmune disease, increased epidermal proliferation.

### Clinical Presentation
*   Well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with silvery scales.
*   Common Sites: Scalp, elbows, knees.

### Management
*   Topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs, topical retinoids, phototherapy, systemic immunosuppressants, biologic agents (e.g., TNF inhibitors, IL-17 inhibitors).

## Contact Dermatitis

### Irritant Contact Dermatitis
*   Etiology: Direct damage to the skin by irritants (e.g., soaps, detergents).
*   Symptoms: Redness, itching, burning, dryness.

### Allergic Contact Dermatitis
*   Etiology: Delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to allergens (e.g., poison ivy, nickel).
*   Symptoms: Redness, itching, vesicles, bullae.

### Management
*   Avoidance of irritants/allergens, topical corticosteroids, emollients.

## Acne Vulgaris

### Pathophysiology
*   Increased sebum production, follicular hyperkeratinization, *Cutibacterium acnes* colonization, inflammation.

### Clinical Presentation
*   Comedones (blackheads, whiteheads), papules, pustules, nodules, cysts.

### Management
*   Topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, oral isotretinoin.

# IV. Skin Cancer

## Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)

### Etiology
*   UV radiation exposure.

### Clinical Presentation
*   Pearly or waxy papule, often with telangiectasia (small blood vessels).
*   Most Common Skin Cancer.

### Treatment
*   Surgical excision, Mohs micrographic surgery, radiation therapy.

## Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)

### Etiology
*   UV radiation exposure, HPV infection.

*   Red, scaly patch or nodule, may ulcerate.

### Treatment
*   Surgical excision, Mohs micrographic surgery, radiation therapy.

## Melanoma

### Risk Factors
*   UV radiation exposure, fair skin, family history.

### Clinical Presentation
*   Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter >6mm, Evolving (ABCDEs of melanoma).

### Types
*   Superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, lentigo maligna melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma.

### Treatment
*   Surgical excision, sentinel lymph node biopsy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy.

# V. Other Skin Conditions

## Urticaria (Hives)

### Etiology
*   Allergic reactions, infections, physical stimuli.

### Clinical Presentation
