# Chroma for RAG #VectorDatabase #RAG #AI
This mind map outlines the use of ChromaDB as a vector database within Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

## Introduction to RAG #RAG #LLM #Architecture
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases before generating a response.

### What is RAG? #Definition #Concept
Combines retrieval models (finding relevant info) with generative models (creating text).

### Why Use RAG? #Benefits #UseCases
-   Provides LLMs with up-to-date or domain-specific information. #Accuracy #Context
-   Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in factual data. #Reliability
-   Allows knowledge base updates without retraining the LLM. #Efficiency #Scalability
-   Enhances response relevance and accuracy. #Performance

### Core Components of RAG #Architecture #Process
-   **Retriever:** Searches an external knowledge source (like a vector database) for information relevant to the user query. #Retrieval #Search
-   **Knowledge Base:** The source of external information, often stored as embeddings in a vector database. #DataSource #Embeddings
-   **Generator:** An LLM that uses the original query and the retrieved context to generate the final response. #LLM #Generation

### RAG Process Flow #Workflow #Steps
1.  User Query Input. #Input
2.  Query Embedding: Convert the query into a vector. #Embedding
3.  Retrieval: Search the vector database for similar document vectors (context). #SimilaritySearch #VectorSearch
4.  Context Augmentation: Combine the retrieved context with the original query into a prompt. #PromptEngineering
5.  Generation: Feed the augmented prompt to the LLM. #Generation
6.  Response Output. #Output
