# II. Foundations: Modeling and Analysis

## Modeling Physical Systems

### Continuous-Time Models

*   Differential equations representing system dynamics.
*   Examples: `dx/dt = f(x, u)`, where `x` is state and `u` is input.

### Discrete-Time Models

*   Difference equations representing system behavior at discrete time intervals.
*   Examples: `x[k+1] = f(x[k], u[k])`.

### Hybrid Models

*   Combining continuous and discrete dynamics.
*   Use of Finite State Machines (FSMs) to model discrete modes of operation.

## Modeling Computational Systems

### Concurrency and Communication Models

*   Petri nets: Graphical representation of concurrent processes.
*   Process algebras (e.g., CSP, CCS): Formal languages for specifying concurrent systems.
*   Examples: Modeling resource allocation and synchronization.

### Real-Time Scheduling

*   Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS): Assigning priorities based on period.
*   Earliest Deadline First (EDF): Assigning priorities based on deadline.
*   Analyzing schedulability using Rate Monotonic Analysis (RMA).

## Analysis Techniques

### Simulation

*   Using tools like Simulink, Modelica, or Python with relevant libraries (e.g., SciPy) to simulate CPS behavior.
*   Examples: Simulating a thermostat control system or an autonomous vehicle.

### Formal Verification

*   Model checking: Verifying system properties against a formal model.
*   Tools: NuSMV, UPPAAL.
*   Example: Verify that a control system maintains stability.

### Stability Analysis

*   Lyapunov stability theory: Proving stability of equilibrium points.
*   Bode plots and Nyquist plots: Analyzing frequency response and stability margins.
