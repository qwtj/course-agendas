Learning Objectives: Understand basic algebraic concepts, solve equations and inequalities, manipulate polynomials and rational expressions, and solve systems of equations.

Prerequisites: Basic arithmetic skills (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with real numbers.

Depth & Scope: Overview of fundamental algebra concepts, suitable for beginners. Boundaries include single variable equations/inequalities, basic polynomial operations, and linear systems of equations.

Target Audience: Beginners or those needing a review of basic algebra concepts.

Technical Details: Examples of solving linear equations (e.g., `2x + 5 = 11`), factoring trinomials (e.g., `x^2 + 5x + 6`), and solving systems of equations using substitution and elimination (e.g., `y = 2x + 1` and `3x + y = 6`). Include checking for extraneous solutions when solving rational equations (e.g., `(2 / x) + (1 / 3) = (5 / x)`).

Relevant Technologies/Tools: None needed; focus on fundamental algebraic concepts.

Preferred Format/Length: Detailed explanations with concise examples for each concept.
