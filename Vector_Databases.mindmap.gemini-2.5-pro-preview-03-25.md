# Vector Databases #Overview #Database #AI
Vector databases are specialized databases designed to efficiently store, manage, and search high-dimensional vector embeddings, typically generated by machine learning models. They are crucial for applications involving similarity search on unstructured data like text, images, audio, and video.

## Introduction and Fundamentals #Basics #Concept #Motivation
Understanding the core ideas and the reasons behind the emergence of vector databases.

### What are Vectors? #DataRepresentation #Math #LinearAlgebra
Vectors are mathematical objects representing points or directions in a multi-dimensional space. In the context of AI/ML, they numerically represent complex data items.

### What are Embeddings? #AI #ML #RepresentationLearning
Embeddings are low-dimensional vector representations of high-dimensional or complex data (like text, images, users) learned by ML models, capturing semantic relationships.

#### Word Embeddings #NLP #Text
Representing words as vectors (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText). #Word2Vec #GloVe

#### Sentence/Document Embeddings #NLP #Text
Representing sentences or entire documents as vectors (e.g., Sentence-BERT, Universal Sentence Encoder). #BERT #Transformers

#### Image Embeddings #CV #Vision
Representing images as vectors using models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Vision Transformers (ViTs). #CNN #ViT

#### Other Embeddings #Various #DataTypes
Representations for diverse data like products, users (for recommendations), molecules (drug discovery), or graph nodes. #Recommendation #Bioinformatics

### Why Vector Databases? #Problem #Need #Motivation
Addressing the need for efficient similarity search at scale.

#### Limitations of Traditional Databases #Comparison #SQL #NoSQL
Traditional databases (SQL, NoSQL) are generally inefficient for high-dimensional vector similarity search.

#### Rise of Unstructured Data & AI/ML #Trend #BigData #AI
The explosion of unstructured data and the success of deep learning models producing meaningful embeddings drive the need for vector databases.

#### The Need for Similarity Search #CoreFunction #Search
Finding items that are "similar" based on their vector representations, not just exact matches.

### High-Dimensional Space #Challenge #Geometry #CurseOfDimensionality
The unique challenges posed by operating in spaces with hundreds or thousands of dimensions.

## Core Concepts #Fundamentals #Principles #Theory
The theoretical underpinnings of vector database operations.

### Vector Space Models #Model #Theory #Representation
Representing data points as vectors in a common multi-dimensional space where distances/angles correspond to similarity.

### Similarity Metrics #Measurement #Distance #Similarity
Mathematical functions used to quantify the similarity or distance between two vectors.

#### Euclidean Distance (L2) #Metric #Distance
Straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. Sensitive to magnitude. #L2Norm

#### Cosine Similarity #Metric #Angle #Direction
Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. Focuses on orientation, not magnitude. Often used for text.

#### Manhattan Distance (L1) #Metric #Distance #CityBlock
Sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. #L1Norm

#### Dot Product #Metric #Projection #Similarity
Inner product of two vectors. Related to Cosine Similarity but also influenced by vector magnitudes.

#### Other Metrics #Specialized #Binary
Metrics like Hamming distance (for binary vectors) or Jaccard index (for sets). #Hamming #Jaccard

### Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) #Search #Problem #Algorithms
The task of finding the vector(s) in a dataset closest to a given query vector according to a chosen similarity metric.

#### Exact Nearest Neighbor (ENN) #BruteForce #Accuracy #Slow
Guarantees finding the absolute closest neighbors by comparing the query vector to every vector in the dataset. Computationally expensive for large datasets.

#### Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) #Approximation #Performance #Scalability
Trades perfect accuracy for significant speed improvements, suitable for large-scale applications. Most vector databases rely on ANN algorithms. #Tradeoff

## Indexing Techniques for ANN #Algorithms #Performance #ANN
Methods used to organize vectors to enable fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor searches.

### Goal of ANN Indexing #Objective #Tradeoff
To accelerate search speed and reduce resource consumption while maintaining a high degree of accuracy (recall).

### Tree-based Indexes #Tree #Hierarchy #Partitioning
Partitioning the vector space using tree structures.

#### KD-Trees #Classic #LowDimension

#### Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) #Probability #Collision #Approximation
Family of hashing techniques where similar items have a higher probability of hashing to the same bucket.

### Graph-based Indexes #Graph #Neighbors #StateOfTheArt
Representing the dataset as a proximity graph where nodes are vectors and edges connect close neighbors. Search involves traversing the graph.

#### Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) #Layers #GreedySearch #Popular
Builds a multi-layered graph structure allowing for efficient greedy search. Widely used due to good performance/accuracy trade-off. #NSW

#### Navigating Spreading-out Graph (NSG) #GraphTraversal #Optimization

### Quantization-based Indexes #Compression #Memory #Approximation
Reducing the memory footprint of vectors, often combined with other index types.

#### Product Quantization (PQ) #Subspace #Centroids #Compression
Divides vectors into sub-vectors, quantizes each subspace separately using clustering (k-means).

#### Scalar Quantization (SQ) #Simple #Compression #Quantization
Reduces precision of vector components (e.g., float32 to int8).

#### Inverted File Index (IVF) #Clustering #Centroids #Partitioning
Clusters vectors using k-means; search is restricted to the cluster(s) nearest to the query vector. Often combined with PQ (IVF-PQ) or SQ (IVF-SQ). #IVFFlat #IVFPQ

### Index Building Process #Construction #Offline #Preprocessing
