# POSIX #OperatingSystems #Standards #API
Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) is a family of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. It defines the application programming interface (API), along with command line shells and utility interfaces.

## Introduction and Overview #Definition #Scope #Goals
Defines what POSIX is, its primary objectives, and the problems it aims to solve.
### What is POSIX? #Definition #InterfaceStandard
An API standard designed to ensure source-level portability of applications across different UNIX-like operating systems.
### Primary Goals #Objectives #Portability #Compatibility
- Source code portability: Write programs once, compile and run on multiple compliant systems.
- Reduce vendor lock-in.
- Standardize OS interfaces.
### Key Concepts #API #Environment #Utilities
- Application Programming Interface (API): C language interfaces.
- Shell: Standard command interpreter interface.
- Utilities: Standard command-line tools (e.g., `ls`, `grep`).
- Conformance: Levels of adherence to the standards.

## History and Standardization #Evolution #IEEE #OpenGroup
Traces the development of the POSIX standards.
### Origins #EarlyUnix #NeedForStandards
Developed from the need to standardize the diverse Unix variants emerging in the 1980s.
Influenced by existing Unix specifications (e.g., SVID, BSD).
### IEEE Std 1003 #StandardBody #WorkingGroup
The formal name for the POSIX standard, developed by the IEEE Portable Applications Standards Committee (PASC).
### The Open Group & Single UNIX Specification (SUS) #Collaboration #SUS
Collaboration between IEEE and The Open Group led to POSIX forming the core of the Single UNIX Specification (SUS).
Current POSIX standards are developed and maintained by the Austin Group, a joint working group of IEEE and The Open Group.
The Base Specifications of SUS are simultaneously IEEE Std 1003.1 and ISO/IEC 9945.

## Core Concepts #Portability #API #Compliance
Fundamental ideas underlying the POSIX standard.
### Source-Level Portability #CodeCompatibility #CompileAnywhere
Enabling applications written using the POSIX API to be compiled and run on any POSIX-compliant system with minimal changes.
### Standardized API #ConsistentInterface #CLibrary
Providing a consistent set of C function calls for system services (e.g., file I/O, process creation).
### Operating System Environment #Shell #Utilities
Defining a standard environment, including command-line shells and common utilities.
### Compliance and Conformance #Levels #Certification
Systems can claim different levels of POSIX compliance, sometimes verified through certification testing.
