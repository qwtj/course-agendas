# I. Introduction to Caddy

## Understanding Caddy's Purpose and Benefits

### Defining Caddy as a Web Server and Reverse Proxy
*   Explaining Caddy's core functionalities: serving static files, proxying requests, and managing TLS certificates.
*   Highlighting Caddy's strengths: automatic HTTPS, easy configuration, and extensibility.

### Contrasting Caddy with Other Web Servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
*   Comparing configuration methods: Caddyfile vs. Apache's `.htaccess` and Nginx's configuration files.
*   Evaluating performance characteristics: Caddy's efficiency in handling HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.
*   Assessing TLS certificate management: Caddy's automated Let's Encrypt integration vs. manual certificate setup.

## Installing and Running Caddy

### Downloading and Installing Caddy on Different Operating Systems
*   Demonstrating installation on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu, CentOS/RHEL), macOS, and Windows.
*   Using package managers (apt, yum, brew, chocolatey) and direct binary downloads.

### Running Caddy as a System Service
*   Configuring Caddy to start automatically on boot using systemd (Linux), launchd (macOS), and services.msc (Windows).
*   Managing Caddy's lifecycle: starting, stopping, restarting, and checking status.
    * Example: `sudo systemctl start caddy`
    * Example: `sudo systemctl status caddy`

# II. Caddy Configuration

## Introduction to the Caddyfile

### Understanding the Caddyfile Structure
*   Explaining the basic syntax of a Caddyfile: site addresses, directives, and blocks.
*   Illustrating a simple Caddyfile for serving static files:

    ```caddyfile
    localhost:8080

    root * /var/www/html
    file_server
    ```

### Site Addresses and Port Binding
*   Defining site addresses using hostnames, IP addresses, and port numbers.
    * Examples: `example.com`, `127.0.0.1:80`, `:443`

### Basic Directives: `root`, `file_server`, `encode`
*   `root`: Specifying the root directory for serving files.
*   `file_server`: Enabling static file serving with optional directory listing.
*   `encode`: Enabling compression (gzip, zstd) for efficient delivery.
    * Example: `encode gzip zstd`

## Advanced Caddyfile Configuration

### Reverse Proxying with `reverse_proxy`
*   Configuring Caddy as a reverse proxy to forward requests to backend servers.
    * Example: `reverse_proxy localhost:9000`
*   Load balancing across multiple backend servers.
    * Example: `reverse_proxy localhost:9000 localhost:9001 localhost:9002`

### TLS Configuration
*   Understanding Caddy's automatic HTTPS functionality using Let's Encrypt.
*   Specifying custom TLS certificate paths (for advanced use cases).
    * Example:
    ```caddyfile
    example.com {
        tls /path/to/cert.pem /path/to/key.pem
    }
    ```

### Using Matchers for Conditional Routing
*   Understanding request matchers (path, header, method, etc.) for routing based on request attributes.
*   Applying matchers within Caddyfile blocks to define specific behavior for different requests.
    * Example using path matcher:
    ```caddyfile
    example.com {
        @api path /api/*
        handle @api {
            reverse_proxy localhost:9000
        }

        handle {
            file_server
        }
    }
    ```

# III. Advanced Caddy Features

## Caddy Modules and Plugins

### Understanding Caddy's Modular Architecture
*   Describing how Caddy's functionality is extended through modules.
*   Explaining how to discover and install Caddy modules.

### Common Caddy Modules
*   `http.handlers.rewrite`: Rewriting request URLs.
*   `http.handlers.redir`: Redirecting requests.
*   `http.authentication.providers.basicauth`: Implementing basic authentication.
*   Example using `rewrite`:
    ```caddyfile
    example.com {
        rewrite /oldpath /newpath
        file_server
    }
    ```

## Caddy API

### Interacting with Caddy via its API
*   Understanding Caddy's API endpoints for configuration management and control.

### Using the Caddy API to Dynamically Configure Caddy
*   Demonstrating how to update Caddy's configuration at runtime using API requests.
    * Example: `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{...}' http://localhost:2019/load`

## Caddy for Specific Use Cases

### Deploying a Static Website with Caddy
*   Serving static content efficiently with Caddy.

### Using Caddy as a Reverse Proxy for Docker Containers
*   Configuring Caddy to proxy requests to applications running in Docker containers.
    * Example: `reverse_proxy my-container:8080`

### Load Balancing with Caddy
*   Implementing load balancing strategies (round robin, least connections) using Caddy's `reverse_proxy` directive and advanced configuration options.
    * Example:
      ```caddyfile
      example.com {
          reverse_proxy {
              to localhost:9000 localhost:9001 localhost:9002
              lb_policy first
          }
      }
      ```

### Setting up HTTPS with Caddy
*   Automatic HTTPS configuration and custom certificate management.
