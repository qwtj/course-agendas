# Guitar Scales #Overview #Fretboard #MusicTheory
The foundational melodic structures used in guitar playing, composition, and improvisation. Understanding scales unlocks the fretboard and enables musical expression.

## Introduction to Scales #Fundamentals #Basics #MusicTheory
Core concepts required to understand and utilize guitar scales effectively.
### What is a Scale? #Definition #Purpose
A sequence of musical notes ordered by pitch, typically spanning an octave, serving as a basis for melody and harmony.
### Why Learn Scales? #Benefits #SkillDevelopment #Musicianship
Improves technique (dexterity, speed, accuracy), ear training, fretboard knowledge, improvisation skills, and compositional understanding.
### Scales vs. Arpeggios vs. Chords #Definitions #Comparison #Harmony
Scales are stepwise sequences, arpeggios are chord notes played individually, chords are notes played simultaneously.
### Basic Music Theory for Scales #Intervals #Notes #Keys
Underlying theoretical knowledge needed for scale construction and application.
#### Musical Alphabet #Notes #Pitch
The 12 notes (A, A#/Bb, B, C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab).
#### Intervals #Distance #Sound #Relationships
The distance between two notes (e.g., Half Step/Semitone, Whole Step/Tone, Major Third, Perfect Fifth). Measured in quality and quantity.
#### Key Signatures & Circle of Fifths #Keys #Relationships #Tonality
Understanding how keys relate to each other and how sharps/flats define a key center.

## Foundational Scales #CoreScales #Beginner #Essential
The most crucial and commonly used scales in Western music, forming the basis for countless melodies and harmonies.
### The Major Scale #Ionian #HappySound #Formula
The cornerstone of Western harmony. Formula: W-W-H-W-W-W-H (Whole, Whole, Half, Whole, Whole, Whole, Half steps). Characteristically bright and happy sound.
### The Natural Minor Scale #Aeolian #SadSound #Formula
The primary minor scale. Formula: W-H-W-W-H-W-W. Characteristically sad or serious sound. Relative minor of the Major scale (starts on the 6th degree).
### The Harmonic Minor Scale #ExoticMinor #RaisedSeventh #Formula
A minor scale with a raised 7th degree. Formula: W-H-W-W-H-WH-H. Creates a distinctive, often dramatic or 'classical' sound due to the augmented second interval between the 6th and 7th degrees. Used frequently over dominant chords in minor keys.
### The Melodic Minor Scale #JazzMinor #ClassicalMinor #Formula
A minor scale with raised 6th and 7th degrees when ascending. Formula (Ascending): W-H-W-W-W-W-H. Often reverts to Natural Minor when descending (Classical tradition) or remains the same (Jazz tradition - hence 'Jazz Minor'). Smoother sound than Harmonic Minor ascending.
### Pentatonic Scales #FiveNote #Rock #Blues
Scales containing only five notes per octave. Widely used in blues, rock, folk, and pop music due to their simplicity and consonant sound.
#### Major Pentatonic #SimpleMajor #Folk #Country
Derived from the Major Scale (degrees 1, 2, 3, 5, 6). Formula: W-W-WH-W-WH. Bright, open, and consonant sound.
#### Minor Pentatonic #SimpleMinor #BluesRock #Essential
Derived from the Natural Minor Scale (degrees 1, b3, 4, 5, b7). Formula: WH-W-W-WH-W. The quintessential scale for blues and rock improvisation.

## Scale Construction & Theory #BuildingBlocks #Formulas #Intervals
Understanding the internal structure of scales and how they are derived.
### Intervals Revisited #Quality #Quantity #EarTraining
Detailed look at interval types (Major, Minor, Perfect, Augmented, Diminished) and their sounds. Crucial for understanding scale formulas and harmony.
### Scale Formulas #Recipes #Patterns #Construction
Defining scales using step patterns (W-H) or interval structures (Root, Major 3rd, Perfect 5th, etc.).
### Deriving Scales #Relationships #TheoryApplication #Connections
Understanding relationships like relative keys (C Major / A Minor), parallel keys (C Major / C Minor), and how modifying one scale creates another (e.g., Natural Minor -> Harmonic Minor).

## Fingering Systems & Patterns #Fretboard #Navigation #Technique
Practical methods for playing scales across the entire guitar neck.
### The CAGED System #Positions #ChordShapes #Visualization
A popular system visualizing the fretboard based on five open chord shapes (C, A, G, E, D). Creates five interconnected patterns for scales and arpeggios. Links scales directly to chord voicings.
### 3-Note-Per-String (3NPS) System #Patterns #Shred #Efficiency
A system using consistent three-note patterns on each string (where possible). Facilitates speed, legato playing, and consistent picking patterns. Often results in 7 distinct patterns for 7-note scales.
### Positional Playing #BoxPatterns #Segments #LearningChunks
Learning scales within specific fret ranges or "boxes". Useful for beginners and certain styles (e.g., Minor Pentatonic "blues box").
### Shifting Positions #ConnectingPatterns #Fluidity #Technique
Techniques (slides, hammer-ons, pull-offs) for moving smoothly between different scale patterns or positions on the neck, creating longer melodic lines.
