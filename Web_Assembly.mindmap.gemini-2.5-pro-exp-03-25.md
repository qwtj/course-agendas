# WebAssembly #Main #Technology #Web #Standard
WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling high-performance applications on the web and other environments. It's an open standard developed by the W3C, aiming to be fast, efficient, portable, safe, and debuggable, running alongside JavaScript.

## Core Concepts #Level1 #Fundamentals
Fundamental ideas and components that define WebAssembly's structure and operation.

### Binary Instruction Format #Level2 #Specification #LowLevel
Wasm code is distributed as a binary format (.wasm), optimized for size and loading speed, representing low-level instructions.

#### Stack Machine Architecture #Level3 #ExecutionModel #VM
Wasm uses a stack-based virtual machine model for computation. Instructions manipulate values on an implicit operand stack.

#### Instructions #Level3 #Operations #Computation
Sequences of operations executed by the Wasm VM. They include simple arithmetic/logic operations and control flow instructions (blocks, loops, conditionals).

#### Values and Types #Level3 #Data #Specification
Wasm defines basic numeric types (32/64-bit integers and floats), a 128-bit vector type (SIMD), and opaque reference types. Integers are used for calculations, boolean logic, and memory addresses.

#### Traps #Level3 #Errors #ExecutionControl
Runtime errors (e.g., accessing out-of-bounds memory, integer division by zero) that immediately halt execution and report to the host environment.

### Text Format (.wat) #Level2 #Debugging #Readability
A human-readable text representation of the Wasm binary format, useful for debugging, writing code by hand, and understanding the low-level structure.

### Module #Level2 #CodeUnit #Encapsulation
A compiled WebAssembly binary (.wasm file) representing a unit of code. Modules are stateless and contain definitions for functions, tables, memory, and globals. They declare imports and exports.

#### Imports #Level3 #Dependencies #Linking
Declarations of resources (functions, memory, tables, globals) that a module requires from its host environment or other modules to execute.

#### Exports #Level3 #API #Linking
Declarations of resources (functions, memory, tables, globals) that a module makes available to the host environment or other modules.

#### Sections #Level3 #Structure #BinaryFormat
The binary format is organized into sections, each containing specific information like type definitions, function code, import/export declarations, memory/table definitions, and custom data.

### Linear Memory #Level2 #MemoryModel #State
A contiguous, mutable, and resizable array of raw bytes (represented as an `ArrayBuffer` in JavaScript) accessed by Wasm instructions for loading and storing data.

#### Resizable ArrayBuffer #Level3 #MemoryManagement #JSAPI
The underlying JavaScript object representing Wasm linear memory, allowing dynamic resizing via Wasm instructions or the JS API.

#### Memory Safety #Level3 #Security #Sandbox
Wasm ensures memory safety through bounds checking; attempts to access memory outside the allocated linear memory result in a trap.

### Table #Level2 #References #IndirectCalls
A resizable typed array holding references (e.g., function references) that cannot be stored directly in linear memory. Primarily used for implementing indirect function calls (like function pointers).

### Instance #Level2 #Execution #State
A stateful, executable instance of a Wasm Module. It pairs the module's code with its runtime state, including its Memory, Table, and imported values. Multiple instances can be created from a single module.

### Host Environment #Level2 #Integration #Embedding
The environment where Wasm code runs, such as a web browser or a standalone Wasm runtime. The host provides APIs for interacting with the outside world.

#### JavaScript API #Level3 #Web #Integration
A set of JavaScript objects and functions (`WebAssembly.*`) for loading, compiling, instantiating, and interacting with Wasm modules within a web browser or Node.js.

##### `WebAssembly.compile()` #Level4 #JSAPI #Compilation
Compiles Wasm binary code into a `WebAssembly.Module`.

##### `WebAssembly.instantiate()` #Level4 #JSAPI #Execution
Compiles and instantiates Wasm code directly, or instantiates an existing `WebAssembly.Module`. Returns both the `Module` and the first `Instance`.

##### `WebAssembly.Module` #Level4 #JSAPI #CodeUnit
Represents compiled, stateless Wasm code. Can be shared between workers.

##### `WebAssembly.Instance` #Level4 #JSAPI #ExecutionState

### Semantic Phases #Level2 #Lifecycle #Process
The conceptual stages a Wasm module goes through from code to execution.

#### Decoding #Level3 #Parsing #BinaryFormat
Processing the binary format (.wasm) into an internal representation understood by the Wasm engine.

#### Validation #Level3 #Verification #Security

### JavaScript Augmentation #Level2 #Web #Integration
Using Wasm modules to accelerate specific, performance-critical parts of a larger JavaScript application.

## Performance #Level1 #Speed #Efficiency
Analyzing WebAssembly's execution speed and efficiency compared to JavaScript and native code.

### Execution Speed #Level2 #PerformanceAnalysis #Comparison
Wasm generally executes faster than JavaScript for CPU-intensive tasks due to its ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, static typing, and low-level nature closer to machine code.

#### Comparison with JavaScript #Level3 #PerformanceAnalysis #JavaScript
Wasm avoids the overhead of JavaScript's dynamic typing and interpretation/JIT compilation for computationally heavy tasks. Speedups vary (e.g., 2-3x to 10x+ reported, highly dependent on workload and JS engine optimizations). JS may still be faster for DOM manipulation or tasks with frequent JS-Wasm boundary crossings.

#### Comparison with Native Code #Level3 #PerformanceAnalysis #Native
Wasm aims for near-native speed but typically runs slightly slower than fully optimized native code due to sandbox overhead, lack of direct access to all CPU features (though SIMD helps), and the indirection through the Wasm runtime.

### Load Time & Size #Level2 #PerformanceAnalysis #Efficiency
Wasm's binary format is compact, leading to potentially faster download times compared to equivalent JavaScript. Decoding and compilation time in the browser is also designed to be fast, often faster than parsing large JS bundles.

### Memory Usage #Level2 #PerformanceAnalysis #Resources
Wasm manages memory within its linear memory space. Manual memory management (in C/C++/Rust) can be efficient but complex. WasmGC aims to provide efficient automatic memory management. Some studies suggest Wasm applications might initially use more memory than highly optimized JS equivalents in certain scenarios, partly due to needing to embed runtime components or pre-allocate linear memory.

### Energy Efficiency #Level2 #PerformanceAnalysis #GreenComputing
Studies suggest Wasm can be more energy-efficient than JavaScript for equivalent computational tasks due to faster execution and less CPU overhead.

### Factors Affecting Performance #Level2 #Optimization #Caveats
Various elements influence the actual performance achieved.

#### Code Optimization #Level3 #PerformanceFactors #Compilation
The effectiveness of optimizations applied by the source language compiler (e.g., LLVM) and Wasm-specific optimizers (like `wasm-opt`).

#### JavaScript Interop Overhead #Level3 #PerformanceFactors #Integration
Frequent calls between JavaScript and Wasm can introduce overhead due to data marshalling and context switching. Minimizing boundary crossings is key for performance.

#### Browser/Runtime Implementation #Level3 #PerformanceFactors #Environment
Performance varies across different browser engines and standalone runtimes due to differences in their Wasm compilers and optimizers.

#### Input Size & Workload #Level3 #PerformanceFactors #Benchmarking
Performance differences between Wasm and JS can change based on the size of the input data and the specific nature of the computation (CPU-bound vs. I/O-bound).

#### Feature Support (SIMD, Threads) #Level3 #PerformanceFactors #Capabilities
Utilizing advanced features like SIMD or threading can dramatically improve performance for suitable tasks, but requires runtime support.

## Security #Level1 #Safety #Sandbox
Mechanisms and considerations related to the security of executing WebAssembly code.

### Sandboxing #Level2 #SecurityModel #Isolation
Wasm code runs in a heavily restricted, sandboxed environment, isolated from the host system and other Wasm instances.

#### Memory Isolation #Level3 #Sandbox #MemorySafety
Each Wasm instance has its own linear memory, inaccessible to other instances or the host except through explicit mechanisms (like JS API or shared memory). Bounds checking prevents out-of-bounds access.

#### Control Flow Integrity (CFI) #Level3 #Sandbox #ExecutionSafety
Wasm's structured control flow and validation rules prevent arbitrary jumps and common control-flow hijacking attacks. Indirect calls are type-checked.

#### Capability-Based Security (via WASI) #Level3 #Sandbox #SystemAccess
WASI adopts a capability-based model where modules are explicitly granted handles (capabilities) for specific resources (e.g., a specific directory), rather than having broad ambient access.

### Host Environment Security Policies #Level2 #SecurityModel #Web
When run in a browser, Wasm adheres to existing web security policies.

#### Same-Origin Policy #Level3 #WebSecurity #Browser
Restricts how Wasm modules loaded from one origin can interact with resources from different origins.

#### Permissions Policies #Level3 #WebSecurity #Browser
Access to sensitive browser APIs (like camera, microphone) is gated by the browser's permission system, just like for JavaScript.

### Potential Vulnerabilities & Mitigations #Level2 #Threats #BestPractices
While the core Wasm model is secure, vulnerabilities can still arise.

#### Vulnerabilities in Implementation #Level3 #Threats #RuntimeSecurity
Bugs in the Wasm runtime (browser engine, standalone runtime) could potentially lead to sandbox escapes (though rare and actively sought by vendors).

#### Vulnerabilities in Application Code #Level3 #Threats #ApplicationSecurity
Standard application-level bugs (logic errors, insecure handling of data passed across the JS/Wasm boundary, vulnerabilities in compiled C/C++ code like buffer overflows if not fully mitigated) can still exist within the Wasm module itself.

#### Side-Channel Attacks #Level3 #Threats #AdvancedAttacks
Theoretical risks similar to those faced by native code (e.g., Spectre/Meltdown variants), although the sandbox limits their impact. Runtimes employ mitigations.

#### Supply Chain Attacks #Level3 #Threats #Dependencies
Malicious code introduced via compromised dependencies (libraries compiled to Wasm).

### Secure Development Practices #Level2 #BestPractices #CodingStandards
Recommendations for writing secure Wasm applications.

#### Input Validation #Level3 #BestPractices #DataHandling
Carefully validate and sanitize any data passed between the host (e.g., JavaScript) and the Wasm module.

#### Secure Coding Standards #Level3 #BestPractices #CodeQuality
Apply secure coding practices relevant to the source language (e.g., memory safety practices in C/C++, handling errors correctly).

#### Least Privilege (via WASI) #Level3 #BestPractices #WASI
When using WASI, grant modules only the minimum necessary capabilities.

#### Dependency Management #Level3 #BestPractices #SupplyChain
Carefully vet dependencies and keep them updated. Use tools for vulnerability scanning.

#### Code Signing & Verification #Level3 #BestPractices #Integrity
Signing Wasm modules to ensure their integrity and authenticity (e.g., wasmCloud's use of JWTs, wasmsign2 tool).

## WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) #Level1 #SystemInterface #Portability
A standardized interface enabling WebAssembly code to interact with system resources outside the browser environment.

### Goals & Motivation #Level2 #WASI #Design
Define a portable, modular, and secure set of APIs for system-level interaction, allowing Wasm code to run consistently across different operating systems and environments (servers, edge, IoT).

### Architecture #Level2 #WASI #Structure
WASI is designed as a collection of modular interfaces rather than a single monolithic API.

#### Modular Interfaces (Worlds) #Level3 #WASI #Modularity
WASI APIs are grouped into interfaces (defined using WIT) like `wasi:filesystem`, `wasi:sockets`, `wasi:clocks`, `wasi:random`. Environments implement specific sets of interfaces, grouped into "worlds".

#### Capability-Based Security #Level3 #WASI #SecurityModel
Core design principle. Modules operate with handles (capabilities) granted by the host, enforcing the principle of least privilege. Access to resources like files or network sockets requires an explicit capability.

#### WIT (Wasm Interface Types) #Level3 #WASI #API #Definition
The Interface Definition Language used to define WASI interfaces and facilitate language interoperability (part of the Component Model).

#### Preview Versions (Preview 1, Preview 2) #Level3 #WASI #Evolution #Versioning
WASI is evolving through preview releases. Preview 1 (based on `witx`) is widely adopted but being superseded by Preview 2 (based on WIT and the Component Model), which is more modular and robust.

## Comparison with JavaScript #Level1 #Web #Alternatives
Highlighting the differences and synergies between WebAssembly and JavaScript.

### Purpose & Design Goals #Level2 #Comparison #Goals
JS: High-level, dynamically-typed scripting language primarily for web interactivity, DOM manipulation, and general web development. Wasm: Low-level, statically-typed binary format designed as a compilation target for performance-critical code, aiming for near-native speed and portability.

### Language Type #Level2 #Comparison #Typing
JS: Dynamically typed. Types checked at runtime. Wasm: Statically typed (at the instruction level). Types checked during validation before execution.

### Execution Model #Level2 #Comparison #Runtime
JS: Interpreted or Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled by browser engines (like V8, SpiderMonkey). Garbage collected. Wasm: Compiled Ahead-of-Time (AOT) to machine code by the Wasm runtime. Linear memory managed manually or via WasmGC. Runs on a stack machine VM.

### Performance Characteristics #Level2 #Comparison #Speed
JS: Highly optimized for many tasks, especially DOM interaction and short-lived operations. Can be very fast due to sophisticated JITs, but overhead for CPU-intensive tasks. Wasm: Generally faster for CPU-bound, numerical computations due to AOT compilation and low-level nature. Can have overhead at the JS/Wasm boundary.

### Use Cases #Level2 #Comparison #Applications
JS: DOM manipulation, UI logic, asynchronous operations, general web scripting, Node.js backend development. Wasm: Performance-critical modules, porting existing C++/Rust/etc. code, computationally heavy tasks (gaming, simulations, media processing), code reuse across platforms (with WASI).

### Interoperability #Level2 #Comparison #Integration
Designed to work together. Wasm modules can be loaded and called from JS. Wasm can import and call JS functions. Data exchange happens primarily via Wasm's linear memory or WasmGC objects. WASI provides system interop outside the browser.

### Tooling & Ecosystem #Level2 #Comparison #Development
JS: Mature, vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools. Easy to get started. Wasm: Ecosystem is growing rapidly but less mature than JS. Often requires compilation toolchains (Emscripten, wasm-pack). Debugging is improving but can be more complex.

### Memory Management #Level2 #Comparison #Memory
JS: Automatic garbage collection. Wasm: Manual management of linear memory (for C/C++/Rust) or integration with WasmGC for garbage-collected source languages.

### Direct API Access #Level2 #Comparison #BrowserAPI
JS: Direct access to all Web APIs (DOM, Fetch, etc.). Wasm: No direct access to Web APIs. Must call out to JavaScript (or use WASI interfaces in compatible environments) to interact with the outside world.
