# II. Core Concepts and Building Blocks

## Understanding Tensors

### Defining Tensors
*   Understanding tensors as multi-dimensional arrays.
*   Defining rank, shape, and data type of tensors.
*   Understanding static vs. dynamic shapes.

### Creating Tensors
*   Using `tf.constant()` to create constant tensors: `tf.constant([1, 2, 3])`.
*   Using `tf.Variable()` to create trainable tensors: `tf.Variable([1, 2, 3])`.
*   Creating tensors with specific data types: `tf.constant([1, 2, 3], dtype=tf.float32)`.
*   Creating tensors with specific shapes: `tf.zeros([2, 3])`, `tf.ones([3, 4])`, `tf.random.normal([5, 5])`.

### Tensor Operations
*   Basic arithmetic operations: `tf.add()`, `tf.subtract()`, `tf.multiply()`, `tf.divide()`.
*   Matrix operations: `tf.matmul()`, `tf.transpose()`.
*   Element-wise operations: `tf.math.exp()`, `tf.math.log()`, `tf.math.sin()`.
*   Reshaping tensors: `tf.reshape(tensor, [new_shape])`.
*   Slicing and indexing tensors: `tensor[0:2, 1:3]`.

## Variables and Automatic Differentiation

### Understanding Variables
*   Defining variables as containers for mutable tensor values.
*   Initializing variables: `tf.Variable(initial_value)`.
*   Assigning new values to variables: `variable.assign(new_value)`.

### Automatic Differentiation with `tf.GradientTape`
*   Understanding automatic differentiation as a method for computing gradients.
*   Using `tf.GradientTape()` to record operations for gradient calculation:
    ```python
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        # Operations involving variables
        loss = compute_loss(y_true, y_pred)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, variables)
    ```
*   Applying gradients to variables using optimizers.

## Building Models with Keras

### Introduction to Keras
*   Understanding Keras as a high-level API for building and training neural networks.
*   Understanding the `Sequential` and `Functional` APIs.

### Building Sequential Models
*   Defining a `Sequential` model: `model = tf.keras.Sequential()`.
*   Adding layers to the model: `model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'))`.
*   Common layer types: `Dense`, `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `Flatten`, `Dropout`.

### Building Functional Models
*   Defining layers as callable objects.
*   Connecting layers using the functional API: `x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu')(input_tensor)`.
*   Creating a model using `tf.keras.Model`: `model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)`.

### Model Compilation
*   Configuring the training process: `model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])`.
*   Choosing an optimizer: `adam`, `sgd`, `rmsprop`.
*   Selecting a loss function: `categorical_crossentropy`, `sparse_categorical_crossentropy`, `mse`, `binary_crossentropy`.
*   Defining metrics: `accuracy`, `precision`, `recall`, `f1_score`.

# III. Training and Evaluating Models

## Data Input and Preprocessing

### Loading Data
*   Using NumPy arrays for data input.
*   Using `tf.data.Dataset` for efficient data loading and preprocessing.
*   Creating datasets from NumPy arrays: `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train))`.
*   Loading data from files (e.g., CSV, images).

### Data Preprocessing
*   Scaling and normalization: `(x - mean) / std`.
*   One-hot encoding categorical data: `tf.one_hot()`.
*   Batching data: `dataset.batch(batch_size)`.
*   Shuffling data: `dataset.shuffle(buffer_size)`.
*   Prefetching data: `dataset.prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)`.

## Training Models

### Model Training with `model.fit()`
*   Training the model on training data: `model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)`.
*   Using validation data to monitor performance: `model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))`.

### Callbacks
*   Using callbacks to customize the training process.
*   `ModelCheckpoint`: saving the best model weights during training.
*   `EarlyStopping`: stopping training early if performance plateaus.
*   `TensorBoard`: visualizing training progress.

## Evaluating Models

### Model Evaluation with `model.evaluate()`
*   Evaluating the model on test data: `model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)`.
*   Obtaining loss and metric values.

### Making Predictions with `model.predict()`
*   Generating predictions on new data: `predictions = model.predict(x_new)`.
*   Interpreting model outputs.

# IV. Advanced Topics

## Custom Training Loops

### Understanding Custom Training Loops
*   Implementing custom training logic for greater control.
*   Iterating over the dataset manually.
*   Calculating loss and gradients within the loop.
*   Applying gradients using optimizers.

### Example Custom Training Loop
```python
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch, (images, labels) in enumerate(train_dataset):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            predictions = model(images)
            loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
```

## Saving and Loading Models

### Saving Models
*   Saving the entire model (architecture, weights, and optimizer state): `model.save('path/to/my_model')`.
*   Saving only the model weights: `model.save_weights('path/to/my_model_weights')`.

### Loading Models
*   Loading the entire model: `loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('path/to/my_model')`.
*   Loading only the model weights:
    ```python
    model.load_weights('path/to/my_model_weights')
    ```
