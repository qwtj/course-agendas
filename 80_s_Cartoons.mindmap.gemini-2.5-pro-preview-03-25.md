Understanding the environment that shaped 80s cartoons.
### Deregulation of Children's Television #FCC #Advertising #ReaganEra
Changes under the Reagan administration and FCC Chairman Mark S. Fowler allowed for programming that directly advertised products to children, leading to a surge in toy-based shows. [3, 18] Prior restrictions, stemming from complaints about shows like *Hot Wheels* in 1969 being "30-minute commercials," were lifted. [18]
### Rise of Syndication #Broadcasting #Distribution
Cartoons weren't just limited to Saturday mornings; weekday afternoon syndication became a major platform for reaching young audiences. [1]
### Decline of Traditional Theatrical Shorts #AnimationHistory #ShiftingMedia
