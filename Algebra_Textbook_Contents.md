# I. Foundations of Algebra

## Understanding Basic Definitions

### Variables and Constants
*   Definition of a variable: A symbol representing an unknown value (e.g., `x`, `y`).
*   Definition of a constant: A fixed value (e.g., `2`, `π`).
*   Examples: `3x + 5`, `y = 2x - 1`.

### Algebraic Expressions
*   Definition: Combinations of variables, constants, and operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation).
*   Examples: `x^2 + 2x + 1`, `(a + b) / c`.

### Equations and Inequalities
*   Definition of an equation: A statement that two algebraic expressions are equal (e.g., `x + 3 = 5`).
*   Definition of an inequality: A statement that compares two algebraic expressions using symbols like `<`, `>`, `≤`, `≥` (e.g., `2x > 4`).

## Operations with Real Numbers

### Properties of Real Numbers
*   Commutative property: `a + b = b + a`, `a * b = b * a`.
*   Associative property: `(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)`, `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`.
*   Distributive property: `a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c`.
*   Identity property: `a + 0 = a`, `a * 1 = a`.
*   Inverse property: `a + (-a) = 0`, `a * (1/a) = 1` (for `a ≠ 0`).

### Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)
*   Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).
*   Example: Evaluate `2 + 3 * (4 - 1)^2`.

### Working with Fractions and Decimals
*   Adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing fractions.
*   Converting between fractions and decimals.
*   Simplifying fractions.

# II. Solving Equations and Inequalities

## Linear Equations

### Solving One-Variable Linear Equations
*   Using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to isolate the variable.
*   Example: Solve `2x + 5 = 11`.

### Solving Multi-Step Linear Equations
*   Combining like terms.
*   Using the distributive property.
*   Example: Solve `3(x - 2) + 4x = 8`.

### Applications of Linear Equations
*   Setting up equations from word problems.
*   Solving for unknowns in real-world scenarios.
*   Example: "John has twice as many apples as Mary. Together they have 15 apples. How many apples does each person have?"

## Linear Inequalities

### Solving One-Variable Linear Inequalities
*   Using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to isolate the variable.
*   Flipping the inequality sign when multiplying or dividing by a negative number.
*   Example: Solve `4x - 3 < 9`.

### Graphing Linear Inequalities on a Number Line
*   Using open and closed circles to represent strict and inclusive inequalities.
*   Shading the region that satisfies the inequality.

### Compound Inequalities
*   "And" inequalities: Solve `2 < x + 1 < 5`.
*   "Or" inequalities: Solve `x - 3 < -1 or 2x > 6`.

## Absolute Value Equations and Inequalities

### Solving Absolute Value Equations
*   Splitting the equation into two cases: `|x| = a` becomes `x = a` or `x = -a`.
*   Example: Solve `|2x - 1| = 5`.

### Solving Absolute Value Inequalities
*   `|x| < a` becomes `-a < x < a`.
*   `|x| > a` becomes `x < -a or x > a`.
*   Example: Solve `|x + 3| ≤ 2`.

# III. Polynomials

## Operations with Polynomials

### Addition and Subtraction of Polynomials

*   Using the distributive property.
*   FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) for multiplying binomials.
*   Example: `(x + 2)(x - 3)`.

### Special Products
*   Difference of squares: `(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2`.
*   Perfect square trinomials: `(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2`, `(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2`.

## Factoring Polynomials

### Factoring Out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)

### Factoring Special Forms
*   Factoring difference of squares: `a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)`.
*   Factoring perfect square trinomials: `a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2`, `a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2`.
*   Factoring sum and difference of cubes: `a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)`, `a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)`.

## Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring

### Zero Product Property
*   If `ab = 0`, then `a = 0` or `b = 0`.

### Solving Quadratic Equations
*   Rewrite the equation in the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`.

*   Example: Simplify `(x^2 - 4) / (x^2 + 4x + 4)`.

## Operations with Rational Expressions

### Multiplying and Dividing Rational Expressions
*   Multiplying: Multiply numerators and denominators separately, then simplify.
*   Dividing: Multiply by the reciprocal of the second fraction, then simplify.
*   Example: `(x / (x + 1)) * ((x^2 - 1) / x^2)`.

### Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions
*   Finding a common denominator.
*   Adding or subtracting numerators.
*   Simplifying the resulting expression.

### Solving for x
*   Solving the resulting equation.
*   Checking for extraneous solutions (solutions that make the original denominator equal to zero).
*   Example: Solve `(2 / x) + (1 / 3) = (5 / x)`.

# V. Systems of Equations

## Solving Systems of Linear Equations

### Graphing
