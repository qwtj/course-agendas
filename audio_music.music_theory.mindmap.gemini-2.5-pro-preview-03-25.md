# Music Theory #Overview #Discipline
The systematic study of the structure, elements, and principles of music, encompassing notation, harmony, rhythm, melody, form, and analysis.

## Fundamentals of Sound and Pitch #Basics #Acoustics #Pitch
Understanding the physical properties of sound and how pitch is organized in music.
### Sound Waves #Physics #Frequency #Amplitude #Timbre
Properties of sound: frequency determines pitch, amplitude determines loudness, and waveform determines timbre (tone color).
### Pitch Systems #Tuning #Temperament #Intonation
Historical and contemporary systems for organizing pitches, including Pythagorean tuning, just intonation, mean-tone temperament, and equal temperament.
### The Octave #Interval #Ratio #Perception
The fundamental interval defined by a 2:1 frequency ratio, perceived as the same pitch class at a higher or lower level.
### Pitch Names and Registers #Notation #Clefs #OctaveDesignation
