# Software Reliability #Overview #QualityAttribute
Software reliability refers to the probability that software will operate without failure for a specified period of time in a specified environment. It is a key attribute of software quality. Unlike hardware, software doesn't wear out but can fail due to design defects (faults) triggered by specific inputs or conditions.

## Fundamentals of Software Reliability #Concepts #Definitions #Basics
Understanding the core ideas and terminology related to software reliability.

### Definitions #Terminology #CoreConcepts
Formal definitions of reliability and related terms.
*   Software Reliability: Probability of failure-free operation for a specified duration in a specified environment.
*   Failure: Observable incorrect behavior or deviation from specified behavior.
*   Fault (Defect/Bug): The underlying cause within the software (e.g., incorrect code, design flaw) that can lead to a failure.
*   Error: A human action that results in a fault.
*   Operational Profile: Characterization of how the system will be used in the field, defining the frequency of different inputs or operations.

### Importance of Software Reliability #Motivation #Impact
Why reliability is crucial for software systems.
*   User Satisfaction & Trust
*   Business Reputation & Cost (e.g., avoiding costly failures)
*   Safety-Critical Applications (e.g., aerospace, medical)
*   Mission-Critical Systems (e.g., finance, infrastructure)

### Key Factors Influencing Reliability #Dependencies #Causes
Factors that affect the reliability of software.
*   Software Complexity
*   Development Process Quality
*   Developer Skill & Experience
*   Testing Thoroughness
*   Operating Environment
*   Operational Profile (Usage Patterns)
*   Software Size (e.g., LOC, Function Points)

### Reliability vs. Hardware Reliability #Comparison #Distinction
Highlighting the differences between software and hardware reliability concepts.
*   Failure Causes: Design faults (software) vs. physical wear-out/manufacturing defects (hardware).
*   Wear-out Phase: Software does not have a wear-out phase like hardware.
*   Environmental Impact: Less direct impact on software itself compared to hardware (though environment affects inputs).
*   Redundancy: Identical software redundancy doesn't protect against design faults.

## Software Reliability Metrics & Measurement #Quantification #Measurement #Metrics
Methods and metrics used to quantify and measure software reliability.

### Key Reliability Metrics #Indicators #KPIs
Common quantitative measures used.
*   Mean Time To Failure (MTTF): Average time between consecutive failures. #MTTF
*   Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF): MTTF + MTTR; average time between inherent failures, including repair time. Often used interchangeably with MTTF for software where repair restores state but doesn't fix underlying fault immediately. #MTBF
*   Rate of Occurrence of Failures (ROCOF): Frequency of failures occurring over a time unit (Failure Intensity). #ROCOF #FailureIntensity
*   Probability of Failure on Demand (POFOD): Likelihood that a request for service will result in failure. #POFOD
*   Availability (AVAIL): Probability that the system is operational when needed (often calculated as MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)). #Availability
*   Mean Time To Repair (MTTR): Average time taken to repair/restore the system after a failure. #MTTR

### Measurement Techniques #Methods #Assessment
Approaches to gathering data for reliability metrics.
*   Time-Based Measurement: Using calendar time or execution time between failures.
*   Transaction/Input-Based Measurement: Counting successful/failed transactions or input cases.
*   Fault Count Measurement: Tracking the number of faults found and removed.
*   Product Metrics (Indirect): Using metrics correlated with reliability (e.g., complexity, size, test coverage). #ProductMetrics #ComplexityMetrics #TestCoverage
