Start content at Markdown heading level 3 (###).</prompt>"

### Direct Proofs
"<prompt>Explain the method of Direct Proof, typically used for proving conditional statements (`p → q`). Describe the process: assume `p` is true and use rules of inference, axioms, definitions, and previously proven theorems to show that `q` must also be true. Start content at Markdown heading level 4 (####).</prompt>"
*   **Examples:** "<prompt>Outline the steps for a direct proof of the statement: 'If `n` is an odd integer, then `n^2` is an odd integer'. Define 'odd integer' (`n = 2k + 1` for some integer `k`). Show the algebraic steps leading to the conclusion that `n^2` fits the definition of an odd integer. Use Markdown formatting and MathJax for equations like $$n = 2k + 1$$. Start content as a Markdown bullet point.</prompt>"

### Proof by Contraposition
"<prompt>Explain the method of Proof by Contraposition, used for proving conditional statements (`p → q`) by proving its logically equivalent contrapositive (`¬q → ¬p`). Describe the process: assume `¬q` is true and use direct proof steps to show that `¬p` must also be true. Start content at Markdown heading level 4 (####).</prompt>"
*   **Examples:** "<prompt>Outline the steps for a proof by contraposition of the statement: 'If `n^2` is an even integer, then `n` is an even integer'. Identify `p` and `q`. State the contrapositive: 'If `n` is not an even integer (i.e., `n` is odd), then `n^2` is not an even integer (i.e., `n^2` is odd)'. Prove the contrapositive using the direct method shown previously. Use Markdown formatting and MathJax for equations. Start content as a Markdown bullet point.</prompt>"

### Proof by Contradiction
"<prompt>Explain the method of Proof by Contradiction (Reductio ad Absurdum). Describe the process: to prove a statement `p`, assume its negation `¬p` is true. Then, using logical steps, derive a contradiction (a statement of the form `r ∧ ¬r`). Conclude that the initial assumption `¬p` must be false, therefore `p` must be true. Start content at Markdown heading level 4 (####).</prompt>"
*   **Examples:** "<prompt>Outline the steps for a proof by contradiction of the statement: 'The square root of 2 is irrational'. Assume `√2` is rational, meaning $$√2 = p/q$$ where `p`, `q` are integers with no common factors and `q ≠ 0`. Square both sides and derive a contradiction regarding the common factors of `p` and `q`. Use Markdown formatting and MathJax for equations like $$\sqrt{2} = p/q$$. Start content as a Markdown bullet point.</prompt>"

### Proof by Cases
"<prompt>Explain the method of Proof by Cases (Proof by Exhaustion). Describe the process: if the hypothesis `p` can be broken down into a finite number of cases `p_1 ∨ p_2 ∨ ... ∨ p_n` that cover all possibilities, prove that each case implies the conclusion `q` (i.e., prove `p_1 → q`, `p_2 → q`, ..., `p_n → q`). Conclude that `p → q` is true. Start content at Markdown heading level 4 (####).</prompt>"
*   **Examples:** "<prompt>Outline the steps for a proof by cases of the statement: 'For any integer `n`, $$n^2 ≥ n$$'. Consider the cases: Case 1: `n = 0`. Case 2: `n > 0` (i.e., `n ≥ 1`). Case 3: `n < 0` (i.e., `n ≤ -1`). Show that the inequality holds true in each case. Use Markdown formatting and MathJax for equations like $$n^2 \ge n$$. Start content as a Markdown bullet point.</prompt>"

### Proofs of Equivalence (IFF statements)
"<prompt>Explain how to prove statements of the form `p ↔ q` (p if and only if q). Describe the standard method: prove both conditional statements `p → q` and `q → p`. Mention that any valid proof technique (direct, contraposition, contradiction) can be used for each part. Start content at Markdown heading level 4 (####).</prompt>"
*   **Examples:** "<prompt>Outline the structure for proving the statement: 'An integer `n` is odd if and only if `n^2` is odd'. Explain that this requires two separate proofs: (1) If `n` is odd, then `n^2` is odd (proven via direct proof earlier). (2) If `n^2` is odd, then `n` is odd (can be proven via contraposition: If `n` is even, then `n^2` is even). Use Markdown formatting. Start content as a Markdown bullet point.</prompt>"

### Existence Proofs (Constructive, Non-constructive)
"<prompt>Explain Existence Proofs, used to prove statements of the form `∃x P(x)`. Describe the two types: Constructive proofs find a specific element `c` for which `P(c)` is true. Non-constructive proofs show that such an element must exist without explicitly finding it (often using contradiction or other indirect methods). Start content at Markdown heading level 4 (####).</prompt>"
*   **Examples:** "<prompt>Provide one example of a constructive existence proof (e.g., 'There exists an even prime number.' Proof: Find `2`, show it's prime and even). Provide one example outline of a non-constructive existence proof (e.g., 'There exist irrational numbers `x` and `y` such that $$x^y$$ is rational.' Consider $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$$; if it's rational, we are done. If it's irrational, let $$x = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$$ and $$y = \sqrt{2}$$, then $$x^y = (\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}})^{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}^2 = 2$$, which is rational). Use Markdown formatting and MathJax. Start content as a Markdown bullet point.</prompt>"

### Uniqueness Proofs
"<prompt>Explain Uniqueness Proofs, used to show that there is exactly one element satisfying a certain property. Describe the common structure: first, prove existence (using a constructive or non-constructive method). Second, assume there are two elements, say `c_1` and `c_2`, that satisfy the property, and then prove that `c_1` must equal `c_2`. Start content at Markdown heading level 4 (####).</prompt>"
*   **Examples:** "<prompt>Outline the steps for proving that the equation `ax + b = 0` (where `a ≠ 0`) has a unique solution. First, show existence: `x = -b/a` is a solution. Second, assume `x_1` and `x_2` are both solutions, so `ax_1 + b = 0` and `ax_2 + b = 0`. Show algebraically that this implies `x_1 = x_2`. Use Markdown formatting. Start content as a Markdown bullet point.</prompt>"

### Counterexamples
"<prompt>Explain the role of Counterexamples in disproving universally quantified statements (statements of the form `∀x P(x)`). Describe how finding just one element `c` in the domain for which `P(c)` is false is sufficient to disprove the entire statement. Start content at Markdown heading level 4 (####).</prompt>"
*   **Examples:** "<prompt>Disprove the statement 'All prime numbers are odd' by providing a counterexample. State the counterexample (`2`) and explain why it fits the hypothesis (is prime) but not the conclusion (is not odd). Use Markdown formatting. Start content as a Markdown bullet point.</prompt>"

*   **Glossary:** "<prompt>Generate a glossary for the 'Modeling Computation' section, including: Alphabet (`Σ`), String, Language (`L`), Formal Grammar (`G=(V,T,S,P)`), Chomsky Hierarchy (Regular, Context-Free, Context-Sensitive, Recursively Enumerable), Finite Automaton (FA), Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), Regular Expression, Kleene's Theorem, Pumping Lemma (for Regular Languages), Turing Machine (TM), Church-Turing Thesis, Halting Problem, Undecidability. Provide concise definitions. Start content at Markdown heading level 3 (###).</prompt>"
*   **Quiz:** "<prompt>Create a short quiz (3-4 questions) for the Modeling Computation section. Include questions on identifying language types from descriptions or grammars, designing a simple DFA or NFA, writing a basic regular expression, or understanding the implications of the Church-Turing thesis and the Halting Problem. Provide answers. Start content at Markdown heading level 3 (###).</prompt>"
*   **Reflective Prompt:** "<prompt>Pose 1-2 reflective questions about Modeling Computation. Examples: 'Why is it useful to have a hierarchy of computational models (like FA, PDA, TM) rather than just using the most powerful model (TM) for everything?' or 'The Halting Problem shows some problems are undecidable. Does this mean computers are fundamentally limited, or does it just define the boundaries of what *algorithmic* computation can achieve?' Start content at Markdown heading level 3 (###).</prompt>"
*   **Further Exploration:** "<prompt>Provide 2-3 suggestions or links for further exploration of Modeling Computation. Include resources like introductions to computability and complexity theory (P vs NP problem), tutorials on parsing context-free languages, information on other computational models (lambda calculus), or the history of Alan Turing and his work. Start content at Markdown heading level 3 (###).</prompt>"
*   **Section Summary:** "<prompt>Write a concise summary paragraph for the 'Modeling Computation' section, covering the formal definition of languages and grammars (Chomsky hierarchy), finite automata (DFA, NFA) and their equivalence to regular expressions for recognizing regular languages, the Pumping Lemma for proving non-regularity, the Turing machine as a universal model of computation, the Church-Turing thesis defining computability, and the concept of undecidability exemplified by the Halting Problem.
