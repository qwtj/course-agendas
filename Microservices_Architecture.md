# I. Introduction to Microservices

## Understanding Monolithic Architecture

### Defining Monolithic Applications
*   Single codebase, single deployment unit.
*   Example: A large e-commerce application deployed as a single WAR file.

### Limitations of Monolithic Architecture
*   Scalability challenges.
*   Deployment bottlenecks.
*   Technology stack limitations.

## Defining Microservices Architecture

### Core Principles of Microservices
*   Single responsibility principle.
*   Decentralized governance.
*   Autonomous teams.

### Characteristics of a Microservice
*   Small, independent, deployable unit.
*   Communicates over a network (e.g., using HTTP or messaging).
*   Owns its own data.

### Advantages of Microservices Architecture
*   Improved scalability.
*   Faster development cycles.
*   Technology diversity.
*   Resilience.

### Disadvantages of Microservices Architecture
*   Increased complexity.
*   Operational overhead.
*   Distributed debugging challenges.

# II. Communication Patterns

## Synchronous Communication

### REST APIs
*   Understanding RESTful principles (statelessness, resource-based).
*   Implementing REST endpoints using frameworks like Spring Boot.
*   Example: Retrieving user data: `GET /users/{userId}`.

### gRPC
*   Defining service contracts using Protocol Buffers.
*   Implementing gRPC services and clients.
*   Advantages of gRPC (performance, code generation).

## Asynchronous Communication

### Message Queues
*   Understanding message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).
*   Publishing and consuming messages.
*   Example: Sending an email notification when a user registers.
    ```java
    // Example with RabbitMQ using Spring AMQP
    @RabbitListener(queues = "registrationQueue")
    public void receiveMessage(User user) {
        // Send email notification
    }
    ```

### Event-Driven Architecture
*   Understanding events and event producers/consumers.
*   Implementing event sourcing.
*   Example: User update event triggers a cascade of updates in related services.

# III. Service Discovery and Configuration

## Service Discovery

### Centralized Service Registry
*   Understanding tools like Eureka, Consul, etcd.
*   Registering and discovering services.
*   Example: A service registering its endpoint with Eureka.

### Client-Side Discovery
*   Clients directly query the service registry.

### Server-Side Discovery
*   Using a load balancer to route requests to available service instances.

## Configuration Management

### Centralized Configuration
*   Using tools like Spring Cloud Config, HashiCorp Vault.
*   Externalizing configuration from code.
*   Example: Storing database credentials in a centralized configuration server.

### Dynamic Configuration Updates
*   Refreshing configurations without restarting services.
*   Example: Using Spring Cloud Bus to propagate configuration changes.

# IV. API Gateway and Security

## API Gateway

### Role of API Gateway
*   Routing requests to backend services.
*   Authentication and authorization.
*   Rate limiting.
*   Request transformation.

### Implementing API Gateway
*   Using tools like Spring Cloud Gateway, Kong, Tyk.
*   Defining routes and filters.

## Security

### Authentication
*   Understanding OAuth 2.0 and JWT.
*   Implementing authentication using Spring Security.
*   Example: Authenticating users against an identity provider.

### Authorization
*   Implementing role-based access control (RBAC).
*   Enforcing authorization policies at the API gateway.

### Secure Communication
*   Using TLS/SSL for encrypting communication between services.

# V. Deployment and Monitoring

## Containerization

### Docker
*   Creating Docker images.
*   Running containers.
*   Example: Dockerfile for a simple Spring Boot application.
    ```dockerfile
    FROM openjdk:17-slim
    COPY target/*.jar app.jar
    ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
    ```

### Orchestration

### Kubernetes
*   Deploying microservices to Kubernetes.
*   Managing deployments, services, and pods.
*   Scaling microservices using Kubernetes.
*   Example: Kubernetes deployment YAML file.

## Monitoring and Logging

### Centralized Logging
*   Using tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk.
*   Aggregating logs from multiple services.
*   Example: Configuring Logstash to collect logs from Docker containers.

### Monitoring
*   Using tools like Prometheus, Grafana.
*   Collecting metrics from microservices.
*   Setting up alerts and dashboards.
*   Example: Monitoring CPU and memory usage of a microservice.

### Distributed Tracing
*   Using tools like Jaeger, Zipkin.
*   Tracing requests across multiple services.
*   Identifying performance bottlenecks.

# VI. Testing Microservices

## Unit Testing

### Testing Individual Components
*   Using testing frameworks like JUnit, Mockito.
*   Writing unit tests for individual classes and methods.

## Integration Testing

### Testing Interactions Between Services
*   Using tools like WireMock, MockServer.
*   Mocking external dependencies.
*   Testing API contracts.

## End-to-End Testing

### Testing the Entire System
*   Using tools like Selenium, Cypress.
*   Automating UI tests.
*   Verifying end-to-end functionality.

## Contract Testing

### Ensuring Compatibility Between Services
*   Using tools like Pact.
*   Defining and verifying contracts between services.

# VII. Advanced Concepts

## CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

### Separating Read and Write Operations
*   Improving performance for read-heavy applications.
*   Using separate data models for reads and writes.

## Event Sourcing

### Storing State as a Sequence of Events
*   Reconstructing state from events.
*   Enabling audit logging and replayability.

## Saga Pattern

### Managing Distributed Transactions
*   Coordinating transactions across multiple services.
*   Implementing compensation transactions.

## Reactive Microservices

### Using Reactive Programming
*   Utilizing Reactive Streams (e.g., using Reactor or RxJava).
*   Building non-blocking and asynchronous microservices.
