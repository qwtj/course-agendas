# I. Foundational Concepts

## Understanding Categories

### Definition of a Category
*   Objects: `Ob(C)` - A collection of things.
*   Morphisms: `Hom(A, B)` for objects A, B in `Ob(C)` - Arrows between objects.
*   Composition: `f: A -> B`, `g: B -> C` implies `g o f: A -> C` exists.
*   Identity: For each object A, there exists `1_A: A -> A` such that `f o 1_A = f` and `1_B o f = f`.
*   Associativity: `h o (g o f) = (h o g) o f` for composable morphisms `f`, `g`, and `h`.

### Examples of Categories
*   `Set`: Objects are sets, morphisms are functions.
*   `Grp`: Objects are groups, morphisms are group homomorphisms.
*   `Top`: Objects are topological spaces, morphisms are continuous functions.
*   A monoid as a category: A single object with morphisms corresponding to the monoid elements.

### Isomorphisms and Automorphisms

* Isomorphism: A morphism `f: A -> B` that has an inverse `g: B -> A` such that `g o f = 1_A` and `f o g = 1_B`.
* Automorphism: An isomorphism from an object to itself.

## Understanding Functors

### Definition of a Functor

*   A functor `F: C -> D` maps objects and morphisms from category `C` to category `D`.
*   Object mapping: `A` in `Ob(C)` maps to `F(A)` in `Ob(D)`.
*   Morphism mapping: `f: A -> B` in `C` maps to `F(f): F(A) -> F(B)` in `D`.
*   Identity preservation: `F(1_A) = 1_F(A)`.
*   Composition preservation: `F(g o f) = F(g) o F(f)`. (Covariant Functor)

### Examples of Functors

*   Forgetful Functor: `U: Grp -> Set` maps a group to its underlying set.
*   Free Functor: `F: Set -> Grp` maps a set to the free group generated by that set.
*   Hom Functor: `Hom(A, -): C -> Set` maps an object `B` to the set of morphisms `Hom(A, B)`.
* Power set Functor: `P: Set -> Set` maps a set `A` to its power set `P(A)`.

### Contravariant Functors

*   Maps morphisms in the opposite direction: `F(f: A -> B) = F(f): F(B) -> F(A)`.
*   Composition reversal: `F(g o f) = F(f) o F(g)`.
*   Example: `Hom(-, A): C -> Set` maps an object `B` to the set of morphisms `Hom(B, A)`.

## Understanding Natural Transformations

### Definition of a Natural Transformation

*   Given functors `F, G: C -> D`, a natural transformation `α: F -> G` is a family of morphisms `α_A: F(A) -> G(A)` for each object `A` in `C`.
*   Naturality Condition: For every morphism `f: A -> B` in `C`, the following diagram commutes: `α_B o F(f) = G(f) o α_A`.

### Examples of Natural Transformations

*   The double dual map for vector spaces.
*   A family of maps between free and abelian groups.

### Natural Isomorphisms

*   A natural transformation `α: F -> G` where each `α_A` is an isomorphism.

# II. Advanced Concepts

## Understanding Adjunctions

### Definition of Adjunctions

*   Functors `F: C -> D` and `G: D -> C` form an adjunction if there is a bijection between `Hom_D(F(A), B)` and `Hom_C(A, G(B))` for all objects `A` in `C` and `B` in `D`.  Write this as `F ⊣ G`.
*   `F` is the left adjoint and `G` is the right adjoint.
*   This bijection must be natural in both `A` and `B`.

### Unit and Counit of an Adjunction

*   Unit: `η: 1_C -> GF` (natural transformation). `η_A: A -> G(F(A))` for all A in C.
*   Counit: `ε: FG -> 1_D` (natural transformation). `ε_B: F(G(B)) -> B` for all B in D.
*   Triangle Identities:  Conditions that must be satisfied by the unit and counit for `F ⊣ G` to hold.

### Examples of Adjunctions

*   Free functor and forgetful functor: `F ⊣ U` where `F: Set -> Grp` and `U: Grp -> Set`.
*   Tensor product and Hom functor.
*   Left adjoints preserve colimits, right adjoints preserve limits.

## Understanding Limits and Colimits

### Definition of Limits and Colimits

*   Diagram: A functor `D: J -> C` where `J` is a small category.
*   Cone: A natural transformation from a constant functor to `D`.
*   Cocone: A natural transformation from `D` to a constant functor.
*   Limit: A universal cone.
*   Colimit: A universal cocone.

### Examples of Limits

*   Product: The limit of a diagram with two objects and no morphisms.
*   Equalizer: The limit of two parallel morphisms.
*   Pullback: The limit of a diagram `A -> C <- B`.

### Examples of Colimits

*   Coproduct: The colimit of a diagram with two objects and no morphisms.
*   Coequalizer: The colimit of two parallel morphisms.
*   Pushout: The colimit of a diagram `A <- C -> B`.

### Complete and Cocomplete Categories

*   Complete category: A category that has all small limits.
*   Cocomplete category: A category that has all small colimits.

## Understanding Monads

### Definition of a Monad

*   A monad on a category `C` is a triple `(T, η, μ)` where `T: C -> C` is a functor, `η: 1_C -> T` is a natural transformation (the unit), and `μ: T^2 -> T` is a natural transformation (the multiplication).
*   Monad Laws:
    *   `μ o Tμ = μ o μT` (associativity)
    *   `μ o Tη = μ o ηT = 1_T` (identity)

### Examples of Monads

*   List Monad: `T(A) = List(A)`, `η(a) = [a]`, `μ` is list concatenation.
*   Maybe Monad: `T(A) = A ∪ {null}`, `η(a) = a`, `μ` removes nested `null` values.
*   State Monad.

### Kleisli Category

*   Given a monad `(T, η, μ)` on `C`, the Kleisli category `C_T` has the same objects as `C`.
*   Morphisms from `A` to `B` in `C_T` are morphisms from `A` to `T(B)` in `C`.
*   Composition is defined using `η` and `μ`.
