# Sqlite #Database #Embedded #RDBMS
SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine implemented as a C library. It's the most widely deployed database engine globally.

## Introduction and Overview #Basics #Introduction #GettingStarted
A general introduction to what SQLite is, its history, and core philosophy.
SQLite was created by D. Richard Hipp in 2000. It's designed to be simple, reliable, and embedded within applications. It's public domain software.

### What is SQLite? #Definition #CoreIdea
SQLite is an embedded relational database management system (RDBMS). It's a library, not a standalone server process.

### Key Characteristics #Features #Philosophy
Summarizes the defining traits of SQLite.
#### Serverless #Architecture #Feature
SQLite reads and writes directly to disk files, requiring no separate server process. This simplifies setup and management.
#### Zero-Configuration #Setup #Administration
No installation, server setup, or administration tasks are needed to use SQLite.
#### Transactional #ACID #Reliability
Supports atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID) transactions, ensuring data integrity even after crashes or power failures.
#### Self-Contained #Dependencies #Portability
Requires no external dependencies, making it easy to integrate into applications.
#### Single File Database #Storage #Portability
An entire database (schema, tables, indexes, data) is stored in a single cross-platform disk file, simplifying deployment and backup.
#### Public Domain #License #Distribution
The source code is in the public domain, allowing free use for any purpose.

### History #Origin #Development
Brief overview of SQLite's creation and evolution. Conceived in Spring 2000 by D. Richard Hipp.

### Common Uses Overview #Applications #UseCases
A quick look at typical scenarios where SQLite excels (covered in more detail later).

## Core Concepts #Fundamentals #DatabaseTheory
Fundamental ideas underpinning SQLite's operation.

### Relational Model #DataModel #SQL
SQLite implements most of the SQL standard and uses the relational model (tables, rows, columns).

### Dynamic Typing (Manifest Typing) #DataTypes #Flexibility
Unlike statically typed databases, SQLite determines a value's type based on the value itself, not rigidly by the column's declared type (unless `STRICT` tables are used).

### Serverless Architecture #Design #NoServer
Elaboration on the absence of a client-server model and direct file access.

### Zero-Configuration Nature #Simplicity #EaseOfUse
Further detail on the lack of setup and administration requirements.

### ACID Compliance #Transactions #Reliability
Explanation of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability in the context of SQLite transactions.

## Data Types #Storage #Schema #SQLTypes
How SQLite handles data types.

### Manifest Typing Explained #DynamicTyping #TypeAffinity
Detailed explanation of how types are associated with values rather than containers (columns).
#### Type Affinity #INTEGER #TEXT #BLOB #REAL #NUMERIC
Explanation of the five storage classes (NULL, INTEGER, REAL, TEXT, BLOB) and how column type declarations influence affinity.

### Supported Data Types #INTEGER #TEXT #BLOB #REAL #NUMERIC #NULL
Primary data types supported: INTEGER, REAL, TEXT, BLOB, and NULL.

### Date and Time Handling #Functions #Storage
SQLite doesn't have dedicated date/time storage types; they are typically stored as TEXT (ISO8601), REAL (Julian day numbers), or INTEGER (Unix timestamp). Built-in functions assist with manipulation.

### STRICT Tables #TypeChecking #Constraint
An optional feature (introduced later) to enforce stricter type checking similar to traditional SQL databases.

## SQL Language Support #SQL #Querying #Manipulation
Details on the SQL dialect supported by SQLite.

## Command-Line Interface (CLI) #Tooling #Administration #Debugging
The `sqlite3` command-line tool for managing SQLite databases.

### Interactive Shell #CLI #Usage
Starting the shell, basic commands.
#### Dot Commands (`.help`, `.tables`, `.schema`, `.quit`, `.read`, `.import`, `.output`, `.dump`) #CLICommands #Management
Special commands prefixed with a dot for managing the database, controlling output, importing/exporting data.

Running SQL statements directly or from files.

### Database Inspection #Schema #DataBrowsing
Using dot commands and SQL to examine database structure and content.

### Data Import/Export #CSV #SQLDump #Backup
Using `.import`, `.output`, and `.dump` for data transfer.

## Concurrency Control #Locking #MultiAccess #WAL
How SQLite handles simultaneous access from multiple processes or threads.

### Locking Mechanisms #Concurrency #FileLocking
SQLite uses file-level locking (traditionally).
#### Shared Lock #Readers #Concurrency
Multiple processes can hold a shared lock simultaneously, allowing concurrent reads.
#### Reserved Lock #Writers #Preparation
A process preparing to write acquires a reserved lock.
#### Pending Lock #Writers #Exclusion
Signals intent to acquire an exclusive lock, preventing new shared locks.
#### Exclusive Lock #Writers #SingleWriter
Only one process can hold an exclusive lock, required for writing. Prevents all other access (read or write).

### Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) Mode #Performance #Concurrency #AlternativeLocking
An alternative concurrency control mechanism (`PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;`).
#### How WAL Works #Journaling #PerformanceBenefit
Changes are written to a separate `-wal` file before being integrated into the main database file (checkpointing).
#### Benefits (Improved Read/Write Concurrency) #ConcurrencyImprovement
Allows readers to continue reading the database while a writer is modifying it, improving concurrency significantly compared to the default rollback journal mode.
#### Drawbacks (Requires Shared Memory, File Management) #WALConsiderations
Requires VFS support for shared memory; involves multiple files (`-wal`, `-shm`).

### Limitations on Write Concurrency #SingleWriter #Bottleneck
While WAL improves read/write concurrency, SQLite still fundamentally allows only one writer to modify the database at any given moment. High-contention write workloads may still face bottlenecks.

## Transactions and Atomicity #ACID #Reliability #DataIntegrity
Ensuring operations are atomic and data remains consistent.

### ACID Properties Revisited #Atomicity #Consistency #Isolation #Durability
Focus on how SQLite ensures these properties.
#### Atomicity #AllOrNothing
Transactions either complete fully or have no effect if rolled back or interrupted (e.g., by power loss). Achieved via rollback journal or WAL.
#### Consistency #DataRules #Constraints
Ensures transactions bring the database from one valid state to another, respecting constraints.
#### Isolation #ConcurrencyControl #Visibility
Ensures concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other in unexpected ways. SQLite typically provides SERIALIZABLE isolation.
#### Durability #Persistence #Recovery
Ensures committed changes are permanent, even after power loss or system crashes (controlled by `PRAGMA synchronous`).

### Rollback Journal #DefaultMechanism #Atomicity
The default mechanism for atomicity. Original page content is written to a `-journal` file before changes are made to the database file.
#### Journal Modes (`DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, `PERSIST`, `MEMORY`, `OFF`) #JournalingOptions #PerformanceTradeoffs
Different strategies for managing the rollback journal file.

### Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) #AlternativeMechanism #Atomicity #Performance
WAL as an alternative mechanism for atomicity and durability, often offering better performance and concurrency.

### Savepoints #NestedTransactions #PartialControl
Using `SAVEPOINT`, `RELEASE`, and `ROLLBACK TO` for finer control within transactions.

## Indexing and Performance Optimization #Performance #QuerySpeed #Tuning
Techniques for improving query performance.

### Indexing Strategies #BTree #PerformanceBoost
Using `CREATE INDEX` to speed up data retrieval.
#### Single-Column Indexes #BasicIndex

#### Partial Indexes (SQLite 3.8+) #ConditionalIndex #StorageSaving
Indexing only a subset of rows in a table based on a WHERE clause.
#### Covering Indexes #QueryOptimization #Performance
Indexes that include all columns needed by a query, avoiding table lookups.

### Query Optimization (EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN) #Analysis #Tuning #Troubleshooting
Using `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` to understand how SQLite executes a query and identify potential bottlenecks or missing indexes.

### ANALYZE Command #Statistics #QueryPlanner
Collects statistics about tables and indexes to help the query planner make better choices.

### VACUUM Command #Defragmentation #FileSizeReduction
Rebuilds the database file, potentially reducing its size and defragmenting storage.

### PRAGMA Settings #Tuning #Configuration
Using pragmas like `cache_size`, `synchronous`, `journal_mode`, `temp_store`, `mmap_size` to tune performance characteristics.

### Database Schema Design #Normalization #Denormalization #PerformanceImpact
How table structure choices affect performance.

## Full-Text Search (FTS) #Searching #TextIndexing #InformationRetrieval
Built-in capabilities for efficient text searching.

Strategies for backing up and restoring SQLite databases.

### Online Backup API #LiveBackup #C_API
A C API (`sqlite3_backup_init`, `sqlite3_backup_step`, `sqlite3_backup_finish`) allowing backups of a live database file without blocking writers for extended periods (works alongside WAL or rollback mode).

### Using the `sqlite3` CLI `.backup` command #Tooling #SimpleBackup
A dot command in the CLI that utilizes the Online Backup API.

### Simple File Copy #OfflineBackup #Simplicity
Possible when the database is not actively being written to. Must ensure no write transaction is in progress. Risky for live databases, especially in WAL mode.

### VACUUM INTO #Backup #Rebuild
Creates a new, vacuumed copy of the database in a different file.

### Recovery from Corruption #DataLoss #Repair
SQLite databases are generally robust, but file system issues or bugs can cause corruption. Recovery options are limited; prevention (backups, reliable hardware/OS) is key.

## Security Considerations #Security #AccessControl #Encryption
Aspects related to securing SQLite databases.

### File Permissions #OSLevelSecurity #AccessControl
Primary mechanism for access control. SQLite relies on the operating system's file system permissions. There are no built-in GRANT/REVOKE commands like in client-server databases.

### SQL Injection #Vulnerability #Mitigation
Protecting against malicious SQL injection by using parameterized queries (prepared statements with placeholders) instead of string concatenation.

### Encryption (SEE - SQLite Encryption Extension) #DataAtRest #Confidentiality
Official, licensed extension for full database file encryption (not free/public domain).
#### Other Encryption Options (SQLCipher, etc.) #ThirdParty #Alternatives
Third-party open-source solutions like SQLCipher wrap SQLite to provide encryption.

### Database Corruption Risks #Integrity #Reliability
Factors that can lead to corruption and mitigation strategies (e.g., `PRAGMA integrity_check`).

## Use Cases and Applications #RealWorld #Scenarios #Examples
Where SQLite is commonly and effectively used.

### Embedded Devices and IoT #Mobile #Appliances #Sensors

### Application File Format #DesktopApps #DataStorage
Replacing custom file formats (like XML, JSON, CSV) for applications (e.g., financial tools, CAD, media catalogs, version control systems like Git). Provides transactional updates and querying capabilities.

### Web Browsers #LocalStorage #History #Settings
Used internally by browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Safari for storing history, bookmarks, cookies, settings, and web storage APIs.

### Mobile Applications (iOS, Android) #AppStorage #LocalData
The standard database for local data storage on both major mobile platforms.

### Websites (Low to Medium Traffic) #WebDev #SimpleSites
Suitable as the database backend for websites with moderate traffic (e.g., < 100k hits/day), especially read-heavy sites or where simplicity is valued.

### Caching Layer #Performance #IntermediateStorage
Acting as a local cache for data retrieved from a remote enterprise database, reducing latency and network load.

### Data Analysis and Prototyping #DataScience #Development #Testing

## Limitations and When Not to Use SQLite #Constraints #Tradeoffs #Alternatives
Scenarios where SQLite might not be the best choice.

### High Write Concurrency #Scalability #WriteHeavy
Systems requiring many concurrent writers may experience bottlenecks due to SQLite's single-writer limitation, even with WAL mode. Client-server databases handle this better.

### Client-Server Applications #NetworkAccess #RemoteData
SQLite is not designed for direct network access. Applications needing shared access over a network typically require a client-server RDBMS (though application-level servers can use SQLite internally).

### Very Large Datasets #Scalability #StorageLimits
While SQLite supports databases up to 281 TB theoretically, practical limits often arise from filesystem constraints or the performance implications of managing extremely large single files. Spreading data across multiple disks/volumes is easier with client-server systems.

### Need for User Management / Granular Permissions #Security #AccessControl
SQLite relies on file system permissions; it lacks built-in user accounts and fine-grained privilege management (GRANT/REVOKE).

### Need for Advanced Replication / High Availability Features #Clustering #Failover
Lacks built-in clustering, sophisticated replication, or automatic failover mechanisms found in enterprise databases.

### Certain SQL Feature Requirements #Compatibility #AdvancedSQL
If specific features omitted by SQLite (e.g., complex ALTER TABLE, stored procedures, materialized views, FOR EACH STATEMENT triggers) are essential.

## Comparison with Other Databases #Alternatives #MySQL #PostgreSQL #EmbeddedDB
How SQLite stacks up against other database solutions.

### SQLite vs. Client-Server RDBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle) #Scalability #Concurrency #Features #Administration
