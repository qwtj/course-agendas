Learning Objectives: Understand categories, functors, natural transformations, adjunctions, limits, colimits, and monads.

Prerequisites: Basic set theory, functions, and familiarity with abstract algebra (groups, rings, fields) and topology.

Depth & Scope: Overview to intermediate; focused on definitions, examples, and fundamental properties, excluding deep proofs.

Target Audience: Computer science graduate students or advanced undergraduates, or software engineers with a strong mathematical background.

Technical Details: Examples in `Set`, `Grp`, `Top`, with emphasis on diagrams and commutative properties; pseudo code for monad examples.

Relevant Technologies/Tools: Abstract algebra, set theory, category theory.

Preferred Format/Length: Detailed explanations with concise examples for each concept.
