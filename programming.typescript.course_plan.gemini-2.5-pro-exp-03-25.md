# I. Introduction and Core Concepts

*   **Learning Objective:** Understand the fundamental concepts of TypeScript, its relationship with JavaScript, and how to set up a basic development environment.

## Why TypeScript? Static Typing benefits
"Starting with heading level 2, explain the core reasons for using TypeScript, focusing on the advantages of static typing over JavaScript's dynamic typing, such as early error detection, improved code maintainability, and enhanced developer tooling."

## Relation to JavaScript (Superset)
"Starting with heading level 2, describe TypeScript's relationship to JavaScript, emphasizing that it is a superset, meaning all valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. Explain how TypeScript adds optional static types and compiles down to plain JavaScript."

## Basic Setup (`tsc`, Playground)
"Starting with heading level 2, provide a step-by-step guide on setting up a basic TypeScript development environment. Include instructions for installing the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) via npm and demonstrate how to use the online TypeScript Playground for quick experiments."

### Basic Types
"Starting with heading level 3, introduce the primitive data types available in TypeScript. Provide brief explanations and examples for each:"
*   **`string`**: "Explain the `string` type for representing textual data. Provide examples of string variable declarations and type annotations."
*   **`number`**: "Explain the `number` type for representing both integer and floating-point numbers. Provide examples of number variable declarations and type annotations."
*   **`boolean`**: "Explain the `boolean` type for representing logical true/false values. Provide examples of boolean variable declarations and type annotations."
*   **`null` & `undefined`**: "Explain the `null` and `undefined` types, their distinction, and their role in representing the absence of value. Discuss the `strictNullChecks` compiler option."
*   **`symbol`**: "Explain the `symbol` type for creating unique identifiers, often used for object property keys. Provide a simple usage example."
*   **`bigint`**: "Explain the `bigint` type for representing integers larger than the maximum safe integer limit of the `number` type. Provide an example."

### Special Types
"Starting with heading level 3, describe special types in TypeScript that serve specific purposes in the type system:"
*   **`any`**: "Explain the `any` type, how it effectively disables type checking for a variable, and the potential risks associated with its use. Provide examples."
    *   "Starting with heading level 4, elaborate on opting out of type checking using `any` and why it should generally be avoided."
*   **`unknown`**: "Explain the `unknown` type as a type-safe alternative to `any`. Demonstrate how values of type `unknown` must be narrowed using type checks before operations can be performed."
*   **`void`**: "Explain the `void` type, primarily used to indicate that a function does not return a value. Provide examples of function signatures using `void`."
*   **`never`**: "Explain the `never` type, which represents values that should never occur. Provide examples, such as functions that always throw errors or have infinite loops."

### Variables and Declarations
"Starting with heading level 3, explain how to declare variables in TypeScript using `let`, `const`, and `var`, including the use of type annotations."
*   **Type Annotations**: "Starting with heading level 4, demonstrate how to explicitly specify the type of a variable using type annotations (e.g., `let name: string = 'Alice';`)."
*   **Type Inference**: "Starting with heading level 4, explain TypeScript's type inference mechanism, where the compiler automatically deduces the type of a variable based on its initial value if no explicit annotation is provided."

### Operators
"Starting with heading level 3, briefly cover the standard JavaScript operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical, etc.) and mention that they work similarly in TypeScript. Highlight any TypeScript-specific considerations if applicable (though minimal for basic operators)."

### Control Flow Analysis
"Starting with heading level 3, explain how TypeScript analyzes code execution paths (e.g., within `if` statements, `switch` cases, loops) to narrow down the possible types of a variable within specific code blocks. Provide examples of type narrowing."

*   **Section Summary:** "Provide a concise summary of the core concepts covered in this section: TypeScript as a typed superset of JavaScript, basic setup, primitive and special types, variable declarations with annotations and inference, and control flow analysis."
