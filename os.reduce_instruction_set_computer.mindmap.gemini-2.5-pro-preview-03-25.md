## Core Philosophy and Design Principles #Philosophy #DesignPrinciples
The fundamental ideas guiding the design of RISC architectures. [1]
### Simplicity #Simplicity #CoreConcept
Emphasis on simplifying the hardware design. [1, 10, 12]
#### Reduced Instruction Set Complexity #InstructionComplexity
Focus on simpler instructions rather than necessarily fewer instructions. Some RISC instruction sets have grown large over time. [1, 20]
#### Simple Hardware Implementation #HardwareDesign #Efficiency
Simpler instructions lead to simpler control logic (often hardwired), reducing chip complexity, size, cost, and design time. [1, 2, 4]
### Performance Optimization #Performance #Optimization
Strategies inherent in the RISC philosophy to enhance execution speed.
#### Single-Cycle Execution (Ideal Goal) #SingleCycle #Speed
Aim for most instructions to execute in a single clock cycle, facilitated by simple instructions and pipelining. [1, 9, 16]
#### Pipelining Emphasis #Pipelining #Throughput
Architecture designed explicitly to be efficient for pipelined execution. [1, 2, 23]
#### Load/Store Architecture #LoadStore #MemoryAccess
Memory access is restricted primarily to explicit load and store instructions; arithmetic/logic operations work only on registers. [1, 2, 9]
#### Reliance on Optimizing Compilers #Compiler #Optimization
Shift complexity from hardware to the compiler, which optimizes instruction sequences and register usage. [1, 2, 20]

## Instruction Set Characteristics #ISA #Instructions
Specific features of typical RISC instruction sets. [1, 3, 16]
### Reduced Number of Instructions (Relative) #InstructionCount
Generally fewer *types* of instructions compared to CISC, focusing on the most frequently used ones. [3, 5]
### Fixed Instruction Length #FixedLength #Encoding
Instructions typically have a uniform length (e.g., 32 bits), simplifying instruction fetch and decode stages in the pipeline. [1, 4, 13]
### Simple Instruction Formats #InstructionFormat #Decoding
Uniform format with consistent opcode placement simplifies decoding logic. [1, 22]
### Limited and Simple Addressing Modes #AddressingModes #Simplicity
Fewer and simpler ways to calculate memory addresses (e.g., register indirect, indexed). Complex addressing modes are synthesized by the compiler using sequences of simple instructions. [1, 2, 5]
### Register-Oriented Operations #RegisterBased
Most operations (arithmetic, logic) operate on data held in registers, not directly on memory locations. [1, 2]

## CPU Architecture and Organization #CPU #Hardware
Typical hardware features and organization of RISC processors.
### Large General-Purpose Register File #Registers #GPR
A large number of registers (e.g., 32 or more) to hold operands and intermediate results, reducing the need for frequent memory accesses. [1, 4, 19]
#### Register Windows (e.g., SPARC) #RegisterWindows #ContextSwitch
A technique using overlapping sets of registers to speed up procedure calls and context switches, prominent in early Berkeley RISC/SPARC designs. [1]
#### Flat Register Space (e.g., MIPS, ARM) #FlatRegisters
Most architectures use a single, large, flat register file accessible by all instructions. [1]
### Simple Control Unit #ControlUnit #Hardwired
Often uses hardwired control logic instead of microcode, which is faster but less flexible. Simplicity of instructions makes hardwired control feasible. [2, 4]
### Datapath Design #Datapath #ExecutionFlow
Optimized for efficient flow of data between registers, ALU, and memory interface, supporting pipelining. [16]

## Pipelining in RISC #Pipelining #Execution
Techniques used to overlap the execution of multiple instructions. [2, 17, 23]
### Basic Pipeline Stages #PipelineStages #InstructionCycle
Common stages involved in executing an instruction.
#### Instruction Fetch (IF) #Fetch #IF
Retrieve the next instruction from memory/cache. [17, 23]
#### Instruction Decode (ID) / Register Fetch (RF) #Decode #ID #RF
Decode the instruction and read required operands from the register file. [17, 23]
#### Execute (EX) / Address Calculation (ALU) #Execute #EX #ALU
Perform the operation (e.g., ALU computation) or calculate a memory address. [17, 23]
#### Memory Access (MEM) #MemoryAccess #MEM
Read from or write to data memory/cache (for load/store instructions). [17, 23]
#### Write Back (WB) #WriteBack #WB
Write the result back to the register file. [17, 23]
### Pipeline Hazards #Hazards #Conflicts
Situations that prevent the next instruction in the pipeline from executing during its designated clock cycle. [17, 25]
#### Structural Hazards #StructuralHazard
Hardware resource conflicts (e.g., needing the same resource in different stages simultaneously). Often resolved by duplicating hardware or careful design. [17, 25]
#### Data Hazards #DataHazard #Dependency
Instruction depends on the result of a prior instruction still in the pipeline (RAW, WAR, WAW). [17, 25]
#### Control Hazards #ControlHazard #Branching
Caused by branch instructions, where the next instruction to fetch is uncertain until the branch condition is evaluated. [2, 17, 25]
### Hazard Mitigation Techniques #HazardResolution #Optimization
Methods to handle pipeline hazards and maintain performance.
#### Forwarding / Bypassing #Forwarding #Bypassing
Sending results directly from one pipeline stage to an earlier stage that needs it, avoiding stalls. [2, 17, 25]
#### Pipeline Stalling / Bubbles #Stalling #Bubbles
Inserting NOP (No-Operation) cycles into the pipeline to wait for dependencies to resolve. [2, 17, 25]
#### Branch Prediction #BranchPrediction #Speculation
Guessing the outcome of a branch (taken/not taken) and speculatively fetching the next instruction. Mispredictions require flushing the pipeline. [2, 25]
#### Delayed Branch #DelayedBranch #InstructionScheduling
Executing one or more instructions immediately following a branch *before* the branch takes effect. The compiler tries to fill this "delay slot" with useful instructions. [2]
### Advanced Pipelining #AdvancedPipelining #Superscalar
Techniques to further improve pipeline throughput.
#### Superscalar Execution #Superscalar #Parallelism
Multiple pipelines executing multiple instructions in parallel per clock cycle. [2, 22, 23]

Compiler groups multiple independent instructions into one long instruction word, explicitly indicating parallelism for the hardware. [21]

## Memory Hierarchy and Access #Memory #Cache
Interaction between RISC processors and the memory system.
### Load/Store Architecture Emphasis #LoadStore #MemoryInteraction
All memory interactions occur through specific Load and Store instructions. Arithmetic/logic instructions do not access memory directly. [1, 2]
### Importance of Caches #Cache #Performance
High reliance on fast cache memory (instruction and data caches, often separate - Harvard architecture principle) to feed the pipeline efficiently due to potentially higher instruction count and frequent register access. [4, 16]
### Memory Addressing #Addressing #VirtualMemory
Interaction with virtual memory systems, Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs). Simpler hardware addressing modes rely on compiler/software for complex address calculations. [1]
