# II. Software Development Methodologies

## Waterfall Model

### Stages of Waterfall: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance
### Advantages and Disadvantages
### When to use Waterfall

## Agile Methodologies

### Agile Manifesto and Principles

### Scrum Framework

#### Scrum Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
#### Scrum Events: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective
#### Scrum Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment
#### Example: Create a user story for an e-commerce website feature.

### Kanban Method

#### Kanban Principles: Visualize Workflow, Limit Work in Progress (WIP), Manage Flow, Make Process Policies Explicit, Implement Feedback Loops, Improve Collaboratively
#### Kanban Board
#### Example: Design a simple Kanban board for a software development team.

### Extreme Programming (XP)

#### XP Values: Communication, Simplicity, Feedback, Courage, Respect
#### XP Practices: Pair Programming, Test-Driven Development (TDD), Continuous Integration, Refactoring, Simple Design
#### Example: Write a simple unit test using TDD principles.

## Choosing a Methodology

### Factors to consider: Project size, complexity, team experience, client involvement, requirements stability
### Hybrid Approaches

# III. Software Project Management in Practice

## Requirements Gathering and Analysis

### Elicitation Techniques: Interviews, Surveys, Workshops, Brainstorming
### Requirements Documentation: User Stories, Use Cases, SRS (Software Requirements Specification)
### Requirements Prioritization
### Example: Conduct a mock interview to gather requirements for a mobile application.

## Estimation Techniques

### Effort Estimation: Story Points, Ideal Time, Function Point Analysis
### Cost Estimation: Bottom-Up, Top-Down, Parametric
### Schedule Estimation: PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique), Critical Path Method (CPM)
### Example: Estimate the effort required to develop a specific software feature using story points.

## Risk Management

### Risk Identification: Brainstorming, Checklists, SWOT Analysis
### Risk Assessment: Probability and Impact Analysis
### Risk Response Planning: Avoidance, Mitigation, Transference, Acceptance
### Risk Monitoring and Control
### Example: Create a risk register for a software development project.

## Communication Management

### Communication Plan
### Communication Channels: Meetings, Email, Instant Messaging, Project Management Software
### Reporting: Status Reports, Progress Reports, Exception Reports
### Example: Draft a communication plan for a software development project.

## Change Management

### Change Request Process
### Impact Analysis
### Change Control Board (CCB)
### Configuration Management
### Example: Process a sample change request for a software development project.

# IV. Tools and Technologies

## Project Management Software

### Jira
    *   Creating projects and boards.
    *   Creating and assigning tasks.
    *   Tracking progress.
    *   Reporting.
### Asana
    *   Project organization and task management.
    *   Collaboration features.
    *   Reporting and analytics.
### Trello
    *   Kanban-style project management.
    *   Collaboration features.
    *   Customization.
### Microsoft Project
    *   Gantt charts and scheduling.
    *   Resource management.
    *   Reporting.

## Version Control Systems

### Git
    *   Basic commands: `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, `git branch`, `git merge`
    *   Branching strategies.
    *   Collaborative workflows (GitHub, GitLab).
### Example: Create a Git repository, commit changes, and push to a remote repository.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

### Jenkins
    *   Setting up CI/CD pipelines.
    *   Automated testing.
    *   Deployment strategies.
### Example: Configure a simple CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins for a sample application.

# V. Special Topics in Software Development

## Technical Debt Management

### Identifying Technical Debt
### Prioritizing Technical Debt Reduction
### Refactoring Techniques
### Example: Identify and refactor a section of code with technical debt.

## Software Quality Assurance (SQA)

### Testing Strategies: Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
### Test Automation
### Performance Testing
### Security Testing
### Example: Write unit tests for a simple function in a programming language.
