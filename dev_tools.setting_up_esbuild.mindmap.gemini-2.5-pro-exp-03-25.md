*   Provide an easy-to-use modern bundler. [4, 9]
*   Create a bundler suitable for the modern JavaScript ecosystem (ES modules, TypeScript, JSX). [31]
### Key Features #Capabilities #Highlights
*   Extreme speed without needing a cache. [4, 9]
*   Built-in support for JavaScript (ESM & CommonJS), CSS, TypeScript, and JSX. [4, 9, 3]
*   Bundling and Code Splitting. [3, 15]
*   Tree Shaking (for ES6 modules). [9, 18, 20]
*   Minification. [3, 4, 9, 15, 18]
*   Source Maps. [3, 4, 9, 15]
*   Development Server & Watch Mode. [4, 9, 20]
*   Plugin API for extending functionality. [4, 9]

## Installation #Setup #GettingStarted
Methods for installing the EsBuild executable.
### Using npm/yarn (Recommended) #PackageManager #NodeJS
Installing EsBuild as a project dependency using npm or yarn.
*   Local installation: `npm install --save-dev --save-exact esbuild` or `yarn add --dev --exact esbuild`. [1]
*   Verification: `./node_modules/.bin/esbuild --version` (Unix) or `.
ode_modules\.binsbuild --version` (Windows). [1]
*   Global installation (optional): `npm install -g esbuild`. [6]
### Manual Installation #Download #Alternative
Downloading prebuilt native executables directly without npm/yarn, e.g., using `curl`. [1]
### Platform Considerations #OS #Compatibility
*   EsBuild installs platform-specific binaries; `node_modules` cannot be simply copied between different OSes. [1]
*   Potential issues on macOS ARM with Node/npm version mismatches (ARM vs x86 via Rosetta). [1]
### Using esbuild-wasm #WebAssembly #Compatibility
An alternative package that works across platforms but with a significant performance cost (potentially 10x slower). [1]

## Basic Usage (Command Line Interface - CLI) #CLI #Commands
Using EsBuild directly from the terminal for simple build tasks.
### Simple Bundling #CoreTask #Example
Bundling a single entry point into an output file.
*   Command: `esbuild entry.js --bundle --outfile=output.js`. [1]
*   Example with React/JSX: `esbuild app.jsx --bundle --outfile=out.js`. EsBuild handles JSX syntax automatically if the file extension is `.jsx` or `.tsx`. [1]
### Key CLI Flags #Options #Configuration
Common flags used for CLI operations.
*   `--bundle`: Enables bundling (combining multiple files). [1, 12]
*   `--outfile=<path>`: Specifies the single output file path. [1, 12]
*   `--outdir=<path>`: Specifies the output directory (used for multiple entry points or code splitting). [2]
*   `--minify`: Enables minification (removes whitespace, shortens variable names). [2, 12]
*   `--sourcemap`: Generates source maps for debugging. [12, 15]
*   `--format=<iife|cjs|esm>`: Sets the output format (e.g., `esm` for ES modules). [15, 21]
*   `--loader:<ext>=<loader>`: Specifies how to load files with a certain extension (e.g., `--loader:.js=jsx` to treat `.js` files as JSX). [1]
*   `--platform=<browser|node|neutral>`: Configures the target platform (adjusts defaults for built-ins, `package.json` fields like `browser`). [1, 20]
*   `--target=<env>`: Specifies the target environment (e.g., `es2020`, `chrome80`) for JS/CSS syntax transformation. [10, 25]
*   `--watch`: Enables watch mode, automatically rebuilding on file changes. [2]
*   `--serve`: Starts a local development server. [2, 20]
*   `--define:K=V`: Replaces global identifiers with constant values. [21]
*   `--external:<package>`: Marks a package as external, preventing it from being bundled. [2]
### Build Scripts (`package.json`) #Automation #npmScripts
Integrating EsBuild commands into `package.json` scripts for easier execution (`npm run build`). [1]

## Configuration via JavaScript API #API #Programmatic

## Core Features & Concepts #Fundamentals #HowItWorks
Key functionalities provided by EsBuild.
### Bundling #CombiningFiles #Modules
Combining multiple JavaScript (or CSS) files and their dependencies into fewer output files, handling different module formats (ESM, CommonJS). [1, 18, 20]
### Minification #Optimization #FileSize
Reducing code size by removing whitespace, comments, and shortening variable names. [3, 12, 15, 18]
### Tree Shaking #DeadCodeElimination #Optimization
Removing unused code (exports) from ES6 modules to reduce bundle size. [9, 18, 20]
### Code Splitting #Performance #OnDemandLoading
Splitting code into multiple chunks that can be loaded on demand or in parallel, improving initial load times (primarily with ESM format). [3, 15, 29]
### Loaders #FileTypes #Transformation
Mechanisms to tell EsBuild how to parse and handle different file types. [3, 25]
*   `js`: JavaScript files (`.js`, `.cjs`, `.mjs`). [3]
*   `jsx`: JavaScript with JSX syntax (`.jsx`). [3]
*   `ts`: TypeScript files (`.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`). [3, 6]
*   `tsx`: TypeScript with JSX syntax (`.tsx`). [3]
*   `css`: CSS files (`.css`). [3, 4]
*   `json`: JSON files (`.json`). [3, 29]
*   `text`: Text files (`.txt`).
*   `base64`: Binary files encoded as base64 strings.
*   `binary`: Binary files included as raw bytes.
*   `copy`: Copies files to output directory.
*   `dataurl`: Embeds files as data URLs.
*   `file`: Copies files to output directory and exports the path.
### Target Environments #Compatibility #Transpilation
Configuring EsBuild to transpile modern JavaScript/CSS syntax down to a version compatible with specific browsers or Node.js versions. [2, 10, 25]
### Source Maps #Debugging #Mapping
Generating files that map the bundled/minified code back to the original source code for easier debugging. [3, 12, 15]
### JSX Support #React #UIFrameworks
Built-in transformation of JSX syntax (used by React, Preact, etc.) into JavaScript. Configurable via `jsxFactory`, `jsxFragment`, etc. [1, 2, 4]
### TypeScript Support #Typing #Compilation
Built-in transformation of TypeScript syntax into JavaScript. Note: EsBuild performs *syntax transformation only*, it does *not* perform type checking. [3, 4, 6, 20]

## Development Workflow Integration #DevWorkflow #DX
Using EsBuild effectively during the development process.
### Watch Mode #AutoRebuild #FileMonitoring
Automatically rebuilding the project when source files change. [2, 4, 9]
*   CLI: `esbuild app.js --bundle --watch ...`. [2]
*   API: Using `esbuild.context()` and calling `.watch()`. [2]
### Development Server #LocalServer #LiveReload
Serving the application locally and often enabling live reloading on changes. [2, 4, 9]
*   CLI: `esbuild app.js --bundle --servedir=public ...`. [29]
*   API: Using `esbuild.context()` and calling `.serve()`. Combining `watch` and `serve` often enables live reload. [2]
### Incremental Builds #Performance #Caching
Rebuilding only the parts of the project that have changed, significantly speeding up rebuilds during development (handled efficiently via the `context` API). [2, 11]

## Production Builds #Deployment #Optimization
Configuring EsBuild to generate optimized bundles suitable for deployment.
### Enabling Minification #FileSize #Performance
Using the `minify: true` option (API) or `--minify` flag (CLI). [12, 20]
### Enabling Tree Shaking #DeadCode #BundleSize
Tree shaking is enabled by default when bundling ES6 modules. [20]
### Setting Target Environment #BrowserSupport #Compatibility
Specifying older targets (e.g., `target: 'es2016'`) to ensure broader browser compatibility. [10]
### Generating Source Maps #Debugging #ProductionDebugging
Using `sourcemap: true` (or other options) to generate source maps for debugging production issues. [12, 20]
### Code Splitting Strategy #LoadingPerformance #Chunks
Using `splitting: true` (with `format: 'esm'`) to break down large applications into smaller, load-on-demand chunks. [15]

## Plugin System #Extensibility #Customization
Extending EsBuild's core functionality using plugins (requires JavaScript or Go API). [4, 5, 28]
### Plugin API Overview #Hooks #Lifecycle
Plugins are objects with a `name` and a `setup` function. The `setup` function receives the `build` object, allowing hooks into the build process. [5]
*   `onStart`: Runs when a build starts.
*   `onEnd`: Runs when a build finishes.
*   `onResolve`: Intercepts module resolution (how `import` statements find files). [5, 28]
*   `onLoad`: Intercepts module loading (how file contents are read and processed). [5, 28]
*   `onTransform` (via `esbuild-extra`): Hook for cooperative file transformation. [19]
### Namespaces #VirtualModules #Isolation
Distinguishing between file system modules (`file` namespace) and virtual modules created by plugins (custom namespaces). [5]
### Common Use Cases for Plugins #Examples #Functionality
*   Handling non-native file types (e.g., SASS/SCSS, Stylus, Vue SFCs, Svelte, MDX, YAML, WASM). [6, 16]
*   Integrating with other tools (e.g., PostCSS). [16]
*   Polyfilling Node.js built-ins for the browser. [17]
*   Implementing custom module resolution logic. [5]
*   Injecting environment variables or version numbers. [16]
*   Copying static assets.
### Finding Community Plugins #Resources #Ecosystem
Lists of available third-party plugins can be found on resources like GitHub. [16, 17]
### Writing Custom Plugins #Development #APIUsage
Creating your own plugins using the `setup` function and build hooks (`onResolve`, `onLoad`). [5]

## Advanced Configuration & Features #Advanced #Techniques
More complex capabilities and configuration options.
### Metafile Generation #BuildAnalysis #Dependencies
Generating a JSON file (`metafile: true`) containing detailed information about the build, including input/output files and dependencies. Useful for analysis.
### Incremental Builds API #Performance #ContextAPI
Leveraging the `context` API for fine-grained control over incremental builds and resource management. [2]
### Using Stdin/Stdout #Piping #CLIFlexibility
Reading input from standard input and writing output to standard output for integration with shell pipelines.
### Tsconfig Paths / BaseUrl #TypeScript #ModuleResolution
Using `tsconfig.json` settings like `paths` and `baseUrl` for module resolution (requires appropriate configuration or plugins). [14]
### Working with `package.json` Fields #NodeResolution #BrowserField
Understanding how EsBuild uses fields like `main`, `module`, and `browser` for resolving package entry points, especially when targeting different platforms (`node` vs `browser`). [1, 2]
### Defining Constants #Globals #CompileTimeVariables
Using the `define` option to replace global identifiers with fixed values during the build (e.g., `process.env.NODE_ENV`). [1]

## Comparison with Other Tools #Bundlers #Alternatives
How EsBuild stacks up against other popular bundlers. [26, 27]
### EsBuild vs Webpack #Webpack #Comparison
*   **Speed:** EsBuild is significantly faster. [3, 26, 27]
*   **Configuration:** EsBuild is much simpler; Webpack is highly configurable but complex. [11, 26, 27]
*   **Plugins:** Webpack has a vast ecosystem; EsBuild's is smaller but growing, relies more on built-in features. [11, 26]
*   **Features:** Webpack has more mature/extensive features out-of-the-box (e.g., HMR, broader loader/plugin scope). [24, 27]
*   **Use Case:** EsBuild for speed/simplicity; Webpack for complex, highly customized builds. [26, 27]
### EsBuild vs Rollup #Rollup #Comparison
*   **Speed:** EsBuild is generally faster. [27]
*   **Focus:** Rollup excels at library bundling and generating clean ESM output. [24, 27]
*   **Tree Shaking:** Both have excellent tree shaking. [24]
*   **Plugins:** Rollup has a mature plugin system, sometimes preferred over EsBuild's for certain integrations (e.g., by Vite). [30]
*   **Use Case:** EsBuild for general speed; Rollup often preferred for libraries. [27]
### EsBuild vs Parcel #Parcel #Comparison
*   **Speed:** EsBuild is generally faster. [27]
*   **Configuration:** Parcel is known for its zero-configuration approach; EsBuild requires minimal configuration but is still more explicit than Parcel. [24, 27]
*   **Features:** Parcel has many built-in transformations and dev server features. [24, 27]
*   **Use Case:** EsBuild for raw speed; Parcel for rapid setup and zero-config development. [27]
### EsBuild in Other Tools (Vite, Snowpack) #Integration #Ecosystem
EsBuild is often used *within* other development tools (like Vite, Snowpack, Nx) for its speed, particularly for dependency pre-bundling and TypeScript/JSX transforms. [14, 20, 29, 30]
