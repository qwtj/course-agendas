## Authorship and Composition #Origins #Sources #DocumentaryHypothesis
Exploring theories about how the Torah came into being.

### Traditional View #MosaicAuthorship #DivineDictation #Sinai
Judeo-Christian tradition holds that the Torah was dictated by God to Moses on Mount Sinai (except perhaps the last verses describing Moses' death).
This is a fundamental tenet of Orthodox Judaism (one of Maimonides' 13 Principles of Faith).
Evidence cited includes passages stating Moses wrote things down (Ex 17:14, Num 33:2, Deut 31:9), references in other biblical books, and statements by Jesus in the New Testament.

### Critical Scholarship View #MultipleAuthors #SourceCriticism #EvolutionOfText
Since the Enlightenment (17th century onwards), most modern scholars reject sole Mosaic authorship based on textual analysis.
Evidence cited includes anachronisms, different divine names (YHWH, Elohim), stylistic variations, duplicate stories (doublets), and apparent contradictions.
Most scholars believe the Torah is a composite work compiled over centuries from multiple sources by different authors/schools.

### Documentary Hypothesis (Classical) #JEDP #Wellhausen
A prominent 19th-century theory proposing four main sources woven together:
*   J (Yahwist): Uses YHWH for God's name, anthropomorphic descriptions, focus on Judah.
*   E (Elohist): Uses Elohim for God's name (until Exodus 3), focus on Northern Israel.
*   D (Deuteronomist): Associated mainly with Deuteronomy, emphasizes covenant and centralized worship.
*   P (Priestly): Focuses on priestly matters, genealogies, rituals, divine majesty, precise laws.
These sources were believed to have been combined by redactors, likely culminating in the Persian period (c. 539–333 BCE).

### Newer Hypotheses and Modifications #SupplementaryHypothesis #FragmentaryHypothesis #NeoDocumentarianism
Classical Documentary Hypothesis is debated and modified by contemporary scholars.
Some emphasize supplementary layers added to core texts, others focus on smaller fragments.
General consensus remains on multiple sources combined over time, likely finalized during the Persian period. Scholars recognize a literary and ideological unity in the final form despite diverse origins.

### Dating #CompositionPeriod #PersianPeriod #HellenisticPeriod
While oral traditions may be much older, the final written form of the Torah is generally dated by critical scholars to the Persian period (6th-4th centuries BCE). Some small additions might be later.
Earliest external references possibly date to the late 4th century BCE (Hecataeus of Abdera, via Diodorus Siculus) or the 3rd/2nd century BCE (Septuagint translation).

## Transmission and Canonization #ScribalTradition #MasoreticText #Canon
How the text was preserved, copied, and accepted as authoritative scripture.

### Scribal Practices #Sofer #Accuracy #Copying
Meticulous rules developed for copying Torah scrolls (Sefer Torah) by trained scribes (Soferim) to ensure accuracy.
Materials (parchment, ink), letter formation, spacing, and correction procedures are strictly defined.

### Masoretic Text (MT) #StandardText #Vocalization #Cantillation
The authoritative Hebrew text of the Tanakh for Rabbinic Judaism.
Developed by the Masoretes (6th-10th centuries CE) who added vowel points (niqqud), punctuation, and cantillation marks (te'amim) to the consonantal text to preserve traditional pronunciation and reading.

### Septuagint (LXX) #GreekTranslation #Alexandria
Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, begun in Alexandria in the 3rd century BCE, starting with the Torah. Important for textual history and its use by Hellenistic Jews and early Christians.

### Samaritan Pentateuch #SamaritanTradition #VariantText
The version of the Torah used by the Samaritans, written in the Samaritan script. Differs slightly from the Masoretic Text.

### Canonization Process #Acceptance #Authority #SecondTemplePeriod
The process by which the five books were accepted as uniquely authoritative scripture. Generally believed to have been finalized by the Persian or early Hellenistic period (c. 4th century BCE), certainly before the other sections of the Tanakh (Nevi'im and Ketuvim).

## Interpretation and Study Methods #Hermeneutics #Midrash #Pardes
Traditional Jewish approaches to understanding the Torah's meaning.

### Importance of Interpretation #OralTradition #MultipleMeanings #Application
Jewish tradition emphasizes that the Written Torah cannot be fully understood without the Oral Torah and ongoing interpretation.
The text is seen as multi-layered, yielding various levels of meaning.

### PaRDeS #FourLevels #Literal #Hint #Homiletical #Mystical
An acronym for the four primary levels of traditional interpretation:
*   **P**eshat: Plain, literal, simple meaning of the text in its context.
*   **R**emez: Hinted or allegorical meaning; allusions found through textual nuances (e.g., gematria).
*   **D**erash (Midrash): Homiletical or interpretive meaning; seeking deeper moral, ethical, or legal lessons, often filling narrative gaps or connecting verses.
*   **S**od: Secret, mystical, or esoteric meaning, often associated with Kabbalah.

### Midrashic Method #Exposition #GapFilling #EthicalLessons
Focuses on close reading of textual details (repeated words, unusual phrasing) to derive deeper meanings, often through narrative expansion, parables, or linking disparate verses.

### Talmudic Logic #LegalReasoning #Debate #Derivation
The methods used in the Gemara to analyze the Mishnah, derive laws (Halakha), resolve contradictions, and explore different rabbinic opinions through logical debate and argumentation.

### Gematria #NumericalValue #Letters #HiddenMeanings
A hermeneutical technique that assigns numerical values to Hebrew letters and words to find hidden meanings or connections between different concepts or verses.

### Modern Approaches #HistoricalCritical #LiteraryAnalysis #Feminist #Postmodern
Contemporary academic and theological approaches bring new perspectives, including historical context, literary artistry, source analysis, and critiques based on modern ethical concerns.

## Role and Centrality in Judaism #Foundation #Practice #Identity

### Foundation of Jewish Law (Halakha) #LegalSource #EthicalGuide
The Torah (both Written and Oral) is the ultimate source for Halakha, guiding religious observance, ethical conduct, and daily life for observant Jews.

### Centrality in Worship #TorahReading #Synagogue #Liturgy
Public reading of the Torah scroll is a central element of synagogue services on Shabbat, Mondays, Thursdays, festivals, and fast days.
The reading follows an annual cycle (or triennial in some communities), ensuring the entire Torah is read over time.
The Torah scroll itself is treated with great reverence.

### Basis of Jewish Belief and Values #Monotheism #Covenant #Ethics #Community
Provides the core narratives, theological concepts (God, creation, revelation, redemption), and ethical values (justice, compassion, sanctity of life) that define Judaism.

### Source of Identity and Connection #Peoplehood #History #Memory
Recounts the foundational history and origins of the Jewish people, fostering a sense of shared identity, history, and destiny rooted in the covenant with God.

### Focus of Study #Learning #TalmudTorah #Education
Torah study (Talmud Torah) is itself considered a primary mitzvah and a central religious activity throughout Jewish history.

### Torah Judaism #Orthodoxy #Observance #Adherence
A term often used by Orthodox Judaism to describe a commitment to the divine origin of both the Written and Oral Torah and adherence to Halakha as derived from them. Implies that this approach represents authentic Judaism.

## Relationship with Nevi'im and Ketuvim (Tanakh) #Prophets #Writings #HebrewBible
The Torah's position as the first and most authoritative part of the three-part Hebrew Bible (Tanakh).

### Tanakh Structure #TorahNeviimKetuvim
The Hebrew Bible is composed of:
*   Torah (Instruction/Law): The five books of Moses.
*   Nevi'im (Prophets): Historical narratives (Former Prophets like Joshua, Kings) and prophetic oracles (Latter Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, the Twelve Minor Prophets).
*   Ketuvim (Writings): Diverse collection including poetry (Psalms), wisdom literature (Proverbs, Job), scrolls read on festivals (Megillot like Esther, Ruth), and later history/apocalyptic (Daniel, Chronicles).

### Primacy of Torah #Foundation #HighestAuthority
Within Jewish tradition, the Torah holds the highest level of sanctity and authority, considered direct divine revelation to Moses.
The Nevi'im and Ketuvim are also divinely inspired but are generally seen as commentary or elaboration based on the Torah's principles.

### Intertextuality #Themes #Interpretation
Nevi'im and Ketuvim often refer back to Torah narratives and laws, interpret them, apply them to new situations, and develop their themes (e.g., covenant faithfulness, justice).

## Relationship with Other Religions #Christianity #Islam #ComparativeReligion
How the Torah is viewed and utilized outside of Judaism.

### Christianity #OldTestament #Pentateuch #Foundation #Fulfillment
The Torah (as the Pentateuch) forms the first five books of the Christian Old Testament.
Viewed as divinely inspired scripture, foundational for understanding God's plan.
Christians traditionally interpret the Torah through the lens of Jesus Christ, seeing it as foreshadowing or fulfilled by him. Debates exist regarding the ongoing applicability of its laws for Christians.
Christians generally accept Mosaic authorship traditionally.

### Islam #Tawrat #HolyBook #Corruption #Confirmation
Islam recognizes the Torah (Arabic: Tawrat توراة) as a holy book originally revealed by God (Allah) to Moses (Musa).
The Quran affirms the divine origin of the Tawrat but teaches that the current versions have been altered or corrupted (Tahrif) by human hands over time.
Muslims believe the Quran confirms the essential truths of the original Tawrat while also superseding it as the final and complete revelation.
Similarities exist in narratives (Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses) and some laws, but interpretations and details often differ.

### Samaritanism #SamaritanPentateuch #SacredScripture
Samaritans consider only the Torah (their version, the Samaritan Pentateuch) as sacred scripture, rejecting the Nevi'im and Ketuvim, as well as the Oral Torah of Rabbinic Judaism.

## Influence and Impact #Culture #Law #Ethics #WesternCivilization
The Torah's far-reaching effects on Jewish and world history, law, ethics, and culture.

The academic, non-devotional study of the Torah using historical, literary, and archaeological methods.

### Goals and Methods #HistoricalContext #Composition #OriginalMeaning
Seeks to understand the Torah's origins, historical development, literary features, and original meaning within its ancient Near Eastern context, separate from later religious interpretations.
Employs methods like source criticism, form criticism, redaction criticism, textual criticism, archaeology, and comparative literature.

### Relationship with Faith Traditions #Tension #Dialogue #Complementarity
Critical scholarship often challenges traditional beliefs (e.g., Mosaic authorship, historicity of narratives).
Some religious scholars engage with critical methods, seeking to integrate historical understanding with faith perspectives ("Torah Umadda" in Modern Orthodoxy).
Others see critical scholarship as distinct from, or even opposed to, traditional Torah study (Limmud Torah), which focuses on religious meaning and application.
Debates exist within religious communities about the legitimacy and role of critical scholarship.

### Key Findings #CompositeNature #HistoricalDevelopment #AncientNearEastContext
Reinforces the view of the Torah as a complex text with a long history of composition, reflecting different periods and perspectives within ancient Israelite society.
