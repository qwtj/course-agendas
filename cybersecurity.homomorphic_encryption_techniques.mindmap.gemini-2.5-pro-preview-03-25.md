# Homomorphic Encryption Techniques #Cryptography #Security #Privacy
Homomorphic Encryption (HE) refers to a class of encryption methods that allow computations to be performed directly on encrypted data (ciphertexts) without needing to decrypt it first. The result of the computation remains encrypted and, when decrypted, matches the result of the same computation performed on the original unencrypted data (plaintexts). [1, 4, 7] This bridges the gap between data privacy and data utility. [6]

## Introduction and Fundamentals #Basics #CoreConcepts #Theory
Provides an overview of HE, its purpose, history, and fundamental properties.
### Definition of Homomorphic Encryption #Definition #Overview
Encryption schemes allowing computation on ciphertexts. The result, when decrypted, is identical to performing the operations on the plaintext. [1, 4, 7] Homomorphism refers to the structure-preserving map between plaintext and ciphertext spaces. [1, 4, 12]
### Motivation and Goals #Purpose #Benefits
Enabling privacy-preserving computations, especially in untrusted environments like the cloud. [1, 5, 8] Allows data processing without revealing the raw data, addressing privacy concerns in fields like healthcare and finance. [1, 6, 7]
### Historical Context #History #Development
First proposed conceptually in 1978 by Rivest, Adleman, and Dertouzos. [1, 6] Remained an open problem for over 30 years until Gentry's breakthrough in 2009 with the first plausible Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme. [1, 6, 7, 10] Early schemes (RSA, ElGamal, Paillier) exhibited partial homomorphism. [1, 3]
### Core Property: Homomorphism #Algebra #StructurePreserving
The ability to perform operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) on ciphertexts that correspond to operations on the underlying plaintexts. [4, 12, 28] `Dec(Enc(m1) op Enc(m2)) = m1 op m2`.
### Data States and HE #DataInUse #SecurityParadigm
Traditional encryption protects data at rest and in transit. HE specifically addresses the security of data *in use*. [5]

## Types of Homomorphic Encryption #Classification #Levels
HE schemes are categorized based on the types and number of operations they can perform on ciphertexts. [3, 4, 7]
### Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) #PHE #SingleOperation
Supports an unlimited number of evaluations for only *one* type of operation (either addition or multiplication) on ciphertexts. [1, 3, 4, 7, 20]
Examples: RSA (multiplicative), Paillier (additive), ElGamal (multiplicative), Goldwasser-Micali (XOR). [1, 3, 7, 12]
### Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE / LHE) #SHE #LeveledFHE #LimitedOperations
Supports *both* addition and multiplication, but only for a limited, pre-determined number of operations (circuit depth). [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 20] Noise increases with each operation, eventually preventing correct decryption. [2, 12] Leveled FHE (LHE) is a form of SHE where parameters are set for a specific circuit depth. [1, 18]
### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) #FHE #ArbitraryComputation
Supports an unlimited number of *both* addition and multiplication operations on ciphertexts, allowing arbitrary computations. [1, 3, 4, 7, 20] Often requires a mechanism like bootstrapping to manage noise. [2, 7, 12]
