# I. Introduction to Make.com

## Understanding Make.com's Core Concepts

### Scenarios and Modules
*   Defining scenarios as automated workflows.
*   Understanding modules as individual actions or triggers.
*   Differentiating between triggers and actions.
    *   Example: A trigger is a new email in Gmail; an action is creating a Google Sheet row.

### Connections
*   Managing connections to different apps (Gmail, Google Sheets, etc.).
*   Understanding API keys and OAuth authentication.
*   Troubleshooting connection errors.

### Data Mapping and Variables
*   Mapping data between modules using variables.
*   Understanding bundle arrays and how to access data within them.
    *   Example: `{{1.subject}}` refers to the subject of the first email in a Gmail module.

## Navigating the Make.com Interface

### The Dashboard
*   Understanding the scenario overview and statistics.

### The Scenario Builder
*   Adding and connecting modules.
*   Duplicating modules, copy-pasting modules, and disabling modules.

### The History Tab
*   Reviewing scenario executions and identifying errors.
*   Analyzing the data flow between modules.
*   Debugging failed executions.

# II. Building Basic Scenarios

## Creating a Simple Scenario: Email to Google Sheets

### Setting up the Gmail Trigger
*   Configuring the Gmail "Watch emails" trigger.
*   Filtering emails based on sender or subject.

### Adding the Google Sheets Action
*   Configuring the Google Sheets "Add a Row" action.
*   Mapping email data (subject, body, sender) to corresponding Google Sheets columns.

### Testing and Activation
*   Testing the scenario before activation.
*   Activating and scheduling the scenario.

## Working with Data Transformers

### Understanding Data Transformation Functions
*   Using functions like `toString`, `toDate`, `replace`, `substring`.
    *   Example: `replace(email, 'example.com', 'newdomain.com')`
*   Working with number formatting using functions like `formatNumber`.

### Implementing Data Transformation in Scenarios
*   Transforming date formats from Gmail to Google Sheets.
*   Cleaning up text data using `replace`.

# III. Advanced Scenario Building

## Working with Iterators and Aggregators

### Understanding Iterators
*   Using iterators to process arrays of data.
*   Creating nested iterations.
*   Using the `map` function within iterators.

### Understanding Aggregators
*   Using aggregators to combine data from multiple bundles.
*   Creating custom aggregations.

### Example: Processing Multiple Attachments from an Email

### Scenario Setup
*   Gmail Trigger -> Iterator (to iterate over attachments) -> HTTP Module (to download attachments) -> Google Drive (to save attachments)

## Error Handling and Scenario Monitoring

### Implementing Error Handling
*   Using error handlers to catch and manage errors.
*   Sending email notifications for failed scenarios.

### Scenario Monitoring
*   Setting up scenario alerts based on error rates.

## Using Webhooks

### Understanding Webhooks
*   Defining webhooks as triggers for scenarios.
*   Securing webhooks using authentication.

### Creating a Webhook-Based Scenario
*   Using a webhook to receive data from a third-party service.
*   Processing the data received via webhook.

# IV. Working with APIs and HTTP Requests

## Understanding API Basics

### API Endpoints and Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
*   Identifying API endpoints in documentation.
*   Understanding the different HTTP methods.

### Authentication Methods (API Keys, OAuth)
*   Implementing API key authentication.
*   Configuring OAuth connections.

## Using the HTTP Module

### Making Basic HTTP Requests
*   Creating `GET` requests to retrieve data from an API.
*   Creating `POST` requests to send data to an API.
    *   Example: Sending a `POST` request to create a new record in a CRM system.

### Handling API Responses
*   Parsing JSON responses.
*   Handling different HTTP status codes (200, 400, 500).

### Advanced HTTP Requests
*   Adding headers to HTTP requests.
*   Using pagination to retrieve large datasets.

# V. Practical Projects

## Project 1: Lead Generation Automation

### Scenario Overview
*   Capture leads from a Facebook Lead Ad and add them to a Google Sheet and a CRM system (e.g., HubSpot).

### Steps
*   Facebook Lead Ads Trigger -> Google Sheets Action -> HTTP Module (for HubSpot API)

## Project 2: E-commerce Order Management

### Scenario Overview
*   Automatically update inventory levels in a spreadsheet based on new orders from Shopify.

### Steps
*   Shopify Trigger -> Google Sheets (Update Inventory)

## Project 3: Social Media Monitoring

### Scenario Overview
*   Monitor Twitter for specific keywords and save relevant tweets to a Google Sheet.

### Steps
*   Twitter Search Trigger -> Google Sheets Action

# VI. Make.com Advanced Topics

## Custom Apps

### Building a Custom App
*   Creating a new app within the Make.com environment.
*   Defining triggers and actions for the custom app.

### Connecting to External APIs
*   Using the custom app to connect to a private or internal API.

## Data Stores

### Using Data Stores
*   Storing data within Make.com's data store.
*   Retrieving and updating data in the data store.

### Example
*   Using the data store to track the number of times a scenario has been executed.

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
*   Establishing clear naming conventions for scenarios and modules.

### Scenario Optimization
*   Optimizing scenarios for performance and efficiency.
*   Minimizing the number of operations to reduce execution time.

### Documentation
*   Documenting scenarios for maintainability and troubleshooting.
