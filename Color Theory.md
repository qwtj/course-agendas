# I. Foundations of Color

## Understanding Color Perception

### The Human Eye and Color
*   How cones and rods detect light.
*   The trichromatic theory of color vision.

### Light and Color
*   The electromagnetic spectrum and visible light.
*   Additive vs. subtractive color mixing.
    *   Additive: RGB (Red, Green, Blue) used in screens. Example: mixing red and green light produces yellow.
    *   Subtractive: CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key/Black) used in printing. Example: mixing cyan and magenta ink produces blue.

## Color Attributes

### Hue
*   Definition and examples of different hues (red, green, blue, etc.).
*   The color wheel as a visual representation of hues.

### Saturation (Chroma)
*   Understanding the purity or intensity of a color.
*   Desaturated vs. highly saturated colors.

### Value (Brightness)
*   The lightness or darkness of a color.
*   Tints (adding white) and shades (adding black).

# II. Color Systems and Models

## RGB Color Model

### How RGB Works
*   Representation of colors as combinations of red, green, and blue light.
*   RGB values ranging from 0-255. Example: `rgb(255, 0, 0)` is pure red.

### RGB in Digital Applications
*   Use in web design (CSS), image editing software (Photoshop).
*   Hex codes for RGB colors (e.g., `#FF0000` for red).

## CMYK Color Model

### How CMYK Works
*   Representation of colors as combinations of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks.
*   CMYK values as percentages. Example: `cmyk(0, 100, 100, 0)` is pure red in printing.

### CMYK in Print
*   Use in printing processes.
*   Understanding color separation.

## HSB/HSV/HSL Color Models

### Hue, Saturation, and Brightness/Value/Lightness
*   An intuitive way to select colors.
*   Adjusting hue, saturation, and brightness independently.

### HSB/HSV/HSL in Software
*   Color pickers in design software.
*   Example: Adjusting the hue to change the base color, saturation to control its intensity, and brightness to control its lightness.

# III. Color Theory Principles

## Color Harmony

### Complementary Colors
*   Colors opposite each other on the color wheel.
*   Creating contrast and visual interest. Example: Red and green.

### Analogous Colors
*   Colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel.
*   Creating a harmonious and peaceful feel. Example: Blue, blue-green, green.

### Triadic Colors
*   Three colors equally spaced on the color wheel.
*   Creating a vibrant and balanced palette. Example: Red, yellow, blue.

### Tetradic (Square) Colors
*   Four colors forming a rectangle on the color wheel.
*   Creating a complex and dynamic palette. Example: Red, green, blue, yellow.

## Color Psychology

### Emotional Associations
*   The psychological effects of different colors.
*   Examples:
    *   Red: Excitement, passion, energy.
    *   Blue: Calm, trust, stability.
    *   Yellow: Optimism, happiness, warmth.

### Cultural Significance
*   How color meanings can vary across cultures.
*   Example: White representing purity in Western cultures but mourning in some Eastern cultures.

## Color Context and Perception

### Simultaneous Contrast
*   How colors affect each other based on their surroundings.
*   A color appearing different depending on the colors next to it.

### Bezold Effect
*   A single color can drastically change the perception of an entire design based on the colors it's placed with.

# IV. Applying Color Theory

## Color Palette Generation

### Using Color Tools
*   Adobe Color, Coolors, Paletton.
*   Exploring different color schemes.

### Creating a Brand Palette
*   Selecting colors that reflect the brand's identity and values.
*   Ensuring consistency across all marketing materials.

## Color in Design

### Typography
*   Choosing appropriate colors for text.
*   Consideration of readability and contrast.

### User Interface (UI) Design
*   Using color to guide the user's eye.
*   Creating a visually appealing and intuitive interface.

### Illustration and Painting
*   Applying color theory to create depth, mood, and visual interest.
*   Using color to tell a story.

## Practical Exercises

### Creating Color Schemes
*   Generate five different color schemes using different color harmonies (complementary, analogous, triadic, etc.).
*   Document the hex codes/RGB values for each color.

### Analyzing Color in Existing Designs
*   Select three different designs (e.g., websites, posters, logos).
*   Analyze the color choices and explain how they contribute to the overall message and aesthetic.

### Applying Color to a Personal Project
*   Choose a small design project (e.g., creating a logo, designing a website mockup).
*   Apply color theory principles to select a color palette and implement it in your design.
