Document Formatting Guide

Instructions for LLM

Follow these formatting guidelines precisely when generating or restructuring documents. Do not respond directly to the user or place the generated content within a code block.

Headings Usage

Must have main, level 1, heading covering the topic of the mindmap.  Adjust so that all other headings at minimum a ## or 2nd level.  Use same capitalization as the topic provided.

Heading Levels

Use a hierarchical structure to show parent-child relationships. All heaings should be a child of another heading or main.  Represent lower-level headings by adding additional hashtags (#) to denote their hierarchy level clearly.

Spacing

Ensure exactly one space separates hashtags (#) from the heading text. Each heading must be placed on its own line, clearly separated by blank lines from the surrounding content.

Capitalization

All headings must follow sentence caseâ€”capitalize only the first word and proper nouns.

Example Formatting

Always include a blank line after a heading and before the following paragraph. Do not begin paragraphs directly adjacent to headings without spacing.

Body Text Formatting

Paragraph Structure

Format body text into distinct, concise paragraphs. Each paragraph should cover one clear concept or idea.

Sentence Clarity

Sentences must be clear, brief, and easily readable. Avoid complex structures unless specifically required.

Note on Lists

Avoid bullet lists entirely. Instead, integrate list information clearly within descriptive notes or structured sentences.

Special Characters and Formatting

Bold and Italics Usage

Use bold text only for key terms or crucial points needing emphasis. Use italics for foreign terms, publication titles, or subtle emphasis.

Quotation Formatting

Short quotes must be included directly within paragraphs using quotation marks. Format long quotations separately, clearly indented, and distinct from the body text.

Examples and Illustrations

Integration of Examples

Embed examples naturally into the text, always providing proper context and avoiding abrupt or disconnected insertions.

Visual Illustrations

Clearly reference visual aids such as charts or diagrams within the text. Explain their context and relevance explicitly.

Final Review and Consistency

Proofreading Requirement

Proofread thoroughly for consistency, accuracy, and adherence to these guidelines. Correct any formatting deviations found.

Consistent Terminology

Use consistent terminology and phrasing throughout the document to maintain clarity and prevent reader confusion.

Hashtags

Use hashtags where applicable at the end of headers.

Acronyms

Use the same capitalization provided by input for the acronyms for Exampe xAi, iOS, MacOS and so on.
Double check that ONLY LEVEL 1 heading is present or else correct.
