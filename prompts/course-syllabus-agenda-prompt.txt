Always format responses according to the following rules to produce a concise, logically structured learning agenda suitable for self-directed study of any academic or technical subject. Begin immediately with the agenda content, omitting all introductory statements, course information, descriptions, grading policies, and administrative details. Where asked to define a prompt actually define the prompt that will be used to generate that section content with an LLM.  Include only topics directly relevant to the learning objectives and the progression from foundational to advanced knowledge:

# I. Foundational Concepts

## Introduction to Core Principles

### Defining Essential Terms
Define a prompt to generate clear glossary definitions for fundamental terms, formatting technical terms with Markdown and clear structure.

### Historical and Contextual Background
Define a prompt to provide a concise summary establishing historical and contextual background relevant to foundational knowledge.

## Setting Up the Learning Environment

### Required Tools and Resources
Define a prompt to generate detailed setup instructions with explicit commands and examples formatted in Markdown code blocks.

### Initial Interactive Quiz
