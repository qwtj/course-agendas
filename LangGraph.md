# II. Building Basic Graphs

## Defining Nodes

### Creating Simple Nodes

    *   Defining a basic node function that returns a dictionary.
    ```python
    def simple_node(state):
        return {"value": state["value"] + 1}
    ```

    *   Implementing `try...except` blocks within nodes to manage exceptions.
    *   Discussing strategies for node failure and graph recovery.

## Defining Edges

### Connecting Nodes with Conditional Edges
    *   Creating conditional edges based on state.
    ```python
    def should_continue(state):
        return "continue" if state["value"] < 5 else "end"
    ```

### Adding Multiple Edges
    *   Demonstrating how to add multiple edges from a single node.

### Compiling the Graph
    *   Understanding the purpose of `.compile()` and its impact on graph performance.

### Running the Graph with Initial State
    *   Using `.invoke()` to execute the graph with an initial state.
    ```python
    graph = StateGraph(SomeState)
    graph.add_node("node_1", some_function)
    graph.add_edge("node_1", "node_2")
    graph.set_entry_point("node_1")
    chain = graph.compile()
    results = chain.invoke({"value": 0})
    ```

### Visualizing Graphs

    *   Using visualization tools (e.g., `graphviz`) to render graph structure.

# III. Advanced Graph Features

## State Management

### Defining Custom State Schemas

    *   Using `TypedDict` to define structured state.
    ```python
    from typing import TypedDict

    class AgentState(TypedDict):
        messages: list[str]
        user_id: int
    ```

### Modifying State within Nodes

    *   Updating and manipulating the state dictionary during graph execution.

### Accessing State Data in Edges
    *   Using state data in conditional edge logic.

## Checkpoints and Persistence

### Implementing Checkpoints
    *   Discussing strategies for periodically saving the graph state.

### Using a Persistence Layer
    *   Integrating with databases or file systems to store and retrieve graph states.

## Parallelism and Concurrency

### Running Nodes in Parallel
    *   Exploring methods for executing nodes concurrently to improve performance.

### Handling Concurrent State Updates
    *   Addressing potential issues with concurrent state modifications and ensuring data integrity.

## Incorporating LangChain Components

### Integrating LLMs and Chains as Nodes
    *   Wrapping LangChain chains or LLMs within LangGraph nodes.

### Passing State to LangChain Components

    *   Mapping LangGraph state data to LangChain input variables.
