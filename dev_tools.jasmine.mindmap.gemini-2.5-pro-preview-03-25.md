## Cultivation and Care #Horticulture #Gardening #Agriculture
Practices involved in growing Jasmine plants.

### Climate and Site Requirements #GrowingConditions #Environment #SiteSelection
Prefers warm temperate, subtropical, or tropical climates. Most need full sun to partial shade. Well-drained soil is crucial. Some species are frost-tolerant (*J. nudiflorum*), others are tender.

### Soil Preparation #SoilMix #Drainage #pH
Requires fertile, humus-rich, well-draining soil. Slightly acidic to neutral pH is generally preferred. Amend heavy soils with organic matter.

### Planting #Timing #Technique #Spacing
Best planted in spring or autumn. Ensure root ball is level with soil surface. Provide adequate spacing for growth, especially for vining types. Support structures (trellis, fence) are needed for climbers.

### Watering #Irrigation #Moisture #WaterNeeds
Requires regular watering, especially during establishment and flowering periods. Soil should be kept consistently moist but not waterlogged. Reduce watering in winter for dormant plants.

### Fertilization #Nutrients #Feeding #PlantHealth
Feed regularly during the growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced fertilizer or one slightly higher in phosphorus to promote blooms. Avoid over-fertilization.

### Pruning and Training #Shaping #Maintenance #Flowering
Prune after flowering to maintain shape, control size, and encourage new growth (which bears next season's flowers). Remove dead or damaged wood. Train vines onto supports.

### Propagation Methods #Reproduction #PlantBreeding #Techniques
Common methods to multiply Jasmine plants.
#### Cuttings #StemCuttings #VegetativePropagation
Semi-hardwood cuttings taken in summer are a common method. Rooting hormone can aid success.
#### Layering #AirLayering #GroundLayering
Bending a low-growing stem to the ground and covering a portion with soil, or wounding a stem and wrapping it with moist medium (air layering).
#### Seeds #SexualReproduction #Germination
Less common commercially, can be slow and variable.

### Harvesting #FlowerPicking #Timing #Yield
Flowers are typically hand-picked early in the morning when their fragrance is most potent, especially for perfumery or tea production.

## Pests, Diseases, and Problems #PlantPathology #PestControl #Troubleshooting
Common issues affecting Jasmine health.

### Common Pests #Insects #Infestation #Damage
Aphids, spider mites, scale insects, mealybugs, whiteflies. Can cause yellowing leaves, stunted growth, honeydew, and sooty mold.

### Common Diseases #Fungal #Bacterial #Pathogens
Leaf spot (fungal), root rot (due to overwatering/poor drainage), rust, blights.

### Control and Management #IPM #Treatment #Prevention
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies: horticultural oils, insecticidal soaps, biological controls (ladybugs), proper sanitation, good air circulation, appropriate watering. Fungicides for diseases if necessary. Addressing environmental stressors.

## Jasmine in Perfumery #FragranceIndustry #Scent #AromaChemicals
The significant role of Jasmine in creating perfumes.

### Scent Profile #Olfactory #Notes #Indolic
Complex, rich, sweet, floral, often with fruity or animalic (indolic) undertones. Considered one of the most important floral notes.

### Role in Fragrance Composition #HeartNote #MiddleNote #Fixative
Typically used as a heart or middle note, forming the core of the fragrance. Can also act as a fixative, helping other notes last longer. Blends well with many other notes (rose, tuberose, citrus, woods).

### Extraction Methods #PerfumeryTechniques #Absolute #EssentialOil
#### Solvent Extraction #Absolute #Concrete
Flowers are treated with a solvent (e.g., hexane) to produce a waxy "concrete". The concrete is then washed with alcohol to yield the highly concentrated "jasmine absolute". This is the most common method for perfumery as it captures the delicate scent well.
#### Enfleurage #TraditionalMethod #Pomade
An old, labor-intensive technique where flowers are laid on trays of fat, which absorbs the fragrance. The scented fat ("pomade") is then washed with alcohol to create an absolute. Rarely used now due to cost.
#### Steam Distillation #EssentialOil #LimitedUse
Not commonly used for jasmine for perfumery as the high heat can damage the delicate aroma molecules. Produces an essential oil, but the absolute is preferred for fine fragrance.

### Key Aroma Compounds #Chemistry #VOCs #ScentMolecules
Benzyl acetate, Linalool, Indole, Cis-jasmone, Methyl jasmonate, Benzyl benzoate. The balance of these creates the characteristic scent. Indole contributes the animalic, narcotic quality.

### Famous Jasmine Fragrances #IconicPerfumes #Examples
Chanel No. 5, Joy (Jean Patou), Samsara (Guerlain), Alien (Mugler), Lust (Lush).

## Jasmine Essential Oil and Aromatherapy #Wellness #TherapeuticUse #HolisticHealth
Use of Jasmine oil for health and well-being.

### Extraction for Aromatherapy #EssentialOil #Absolute #CO2Extraction
While absolutes are common, sometimes CO2 extracts or blends are used. True steam-distilled Jasmine essential oil is rare and different from the absolute.

### Therapeutic Properties #Benefits #Effects #TraditionalUse
Known for properties such as:
#### Antidepressant & Uplifting #MoodBooster #EmotionalSupport
Used to alleviate symptoms of depression, lift spirits, and promote optimism.
#### Anxiolytic & Relaxing #StressRelief #Calming
Helps reduce anxiety, nervous tension, and stress. Promotes relaxation.
#### Aphrodisiac #Libido #Romance
Traditionally considered to enhance sensuality and intimacy.
#### Sedative #SleepAid #Insomnia

#### Emmenagogue #WomensHealth (Use with caution)
Historically used to regulate menstruation (avoid during pregnancy).
#### Cicatrisant #SkinCare #ScarHealing
May aid in skin healing and reducing the appearance of scars (often diluted).

### Methods of Use #Application #Diffusion #Massage
Inhalation (diffusion, personal inhaler), topical application (diluted in carrier oil for massage, skincare), baths.

### Safety Precautions #Contraindications #Dilution #Sensitivity
Jasmine absolute/oil is potent and should be used diluted. Potential for skin sensitization. Avoid use during pregnancy due to emmenagogue effect. Use with caution if prone to headaches. Perform patch test before topical use. Ensure sourcing of high-quality, authentic oil.

## Culinary Uses #Food #Flavoring #JasmineTea
Incorporation of Jasmine flowers and flavor in food and beverages.

### Jasmine Tea #ScentedTea #ChineseTea #Preparation
Most common culinary use. Typically made by layering green, white, or pouchong tea leaves with fresh *Jasminum sambac* or *Jasminum officinale* flowers, allowing the tea to absorb the aroma. Flowers are often removed before packaging. Different grades exist based on tea quality and scenting process.

### Flavoring Agent #Desserts #Syrups #Infusions
Jasmine flowers or syrup can be used to flavor desserts like puddings, ice cream, cakes, panna cotta. Can infuse creams, sugars, or create syrups for cocktails or beverages.

### Edible Flowers #Garnish #Decoration

## Health and Medicinal Aspects #TraditionalMedicine #Pharmacology #Research
Exploration of Jasmine's use in health contexts, beyond aromatherapy.

### Traditional Medicine Systems #Ayurveda #TCM #FolkMedicine
Used historically in systems like Ayurveda for skin conditions, eye issues, headaches, and as an aphrodisiac or relaxant. Use varies by region and tradition.

### Potential Health Benefits (Research Areas) #Antioxidant #Antiinflammatory #Antimicrobial
Preliminary research suggests potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and mood-regulating effects, but more clinical studies are needed. Often linked to compounds found in the plant or its extracts.
