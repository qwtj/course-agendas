### Reporting Vulnerabilities
"<prompt>Generate content starting at heading level 3. Briefly touch upon the concept of responsible disclosure. Mention that if vulnerabilities are found in dependencies or other modules, there are established processes for reporting them privately to the maintainers before public disclosure, often involving platforms like GitHub Security Advisories or HackerOne.
