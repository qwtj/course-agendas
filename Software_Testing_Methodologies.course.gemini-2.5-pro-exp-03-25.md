### Data-Driven Testing
"<prompt> Explain the Data-Driven Testing (DDT) approach for test automation. Describe how test logic (scripts) is separated from test data (inputs and expected outputs), often stored in external files (like spreadsheets, CSV, databases). Explain how this allows running the same test script with multiple data sets efficiently."

### Keyword-Driven Testing
"<prompt> Explain the Keyword-Driven Testing (KDT) or Table-Driven Testing approach. Describe how test cases are designed using predefined keywords representing actions (e.g., `login`, `verifyElementPresent`, `typeText`). Explain how this abstracts the test logic, potentially allowing non-programmers to define tests, separating test design from script implementation."

Mention strategies like detailed logging, video recording of test execution, analyzing environment differences, and systematic isolation of the failure point."

## Mutation Testing
"<prompt> Define Mutation Testing. Explain it as a technique used to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of an existing test suite (often unit tests). Describe how it works: automatically introducing small faults (mutations) into the source code and checking if the test suite detects (kills) these mutants. A high percentage of killed mutants suggests a more effective test suite."

## Chaos Engineering
"<prompt> Introduce Chaos Engineering as a discipline related to Shift-Right testing (Section IV).
