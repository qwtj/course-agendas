# III. Network Microsegmentation

## Understanding network segmentation techniques.

### VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks).
### Firewall rules.
### Network Access Control Lists (ACLs).

## Implementing microsegmentation for Zero Trust.

### Defining security zones based on data sensitivity and criticality.
### Using software-defined networking (SDN) for granular control.
    * OpenFlow.
    * Network virtualization.
### Deploying microperimeters around critical assets.

## Tools and technologies for microsegmentation.

### Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs).
### Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS).
### Service mesh architectures (e.g., Istio, Linkerd).

# IV. Data Security and Protection

### Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for policy deployment.
    * Terraform.
    * Ansible.
    * CloudFormation.
    * ARM
    * Pulumi
    * Ninja
