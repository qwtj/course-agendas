# Flow Architecture #Overview #SystemDesign
Flow Architecture refers to system designs, particularly in software and data engineering, that emphasize the movement and transformation of data or tasks through a series of processing steps. It models systems as interconnected components where data or control "flows" between them. This approach focuses on enhancing modularity, scalability, reusability, and maintainability.

## Core Concepts and Principles #Fundamentals #Theory
Fundamental ideas underpinning flow-based systems.
### Data Flow vs Control Flow #Comparison #ExecutionModel
Distinguishing between architectures driven by data availability versus those driven by predefined execution order. Data flow architectures are data-driven, while control flow architectures are task-driven.
### Flow-Based Programming (FBP) #Paradigm #ProgrammingModel
A programming paradigm defining applications as networks of "black box" processes exchanging data across predefined connections.
### Nodes/Components #BuildingBlocks #Modularity
Independent processing units performing specific tasks (e.g., filtering, transforming, aggregating). Modularity is a key characteristic.
### Connections/Pipes #Communication #DataTransfer
Channels through which data packets or messages move between nodes unidirectionally.
### Data Packets/Messages #DataUnits #Information
Units of data that flow through the system.
### Ports (Input/Output) #Interfaces #Connections
Defined points on nodes where connections are made for data ingress and egress.
### Backpressure #FlowControl #Resilience
Mechanisms to handle situations where a downstream component cannot process data as fast as an upstream component produces it.
### Loose Coupling #Decoupling #Modularity
Components operate independently with minimal dependencies on others, interacting only through defined interfaces (pipes/connections).

## Key Architectural Patterns #Patterns #Design
Established structures and approaches for organizing flows.
### Pipes and Filters #Pattern #DataProcessing
A classic pattern where data flows sequentially through a series of filters (processing steps) connected by pipes (channels). Used in data transformation and processing.
### Batch Sequential #Pattern #BatchProcessing
Data is processed in discrete batches, with each processing step completing before the next one begins. A traditional data processing model.
### Process Control #Pattern #RealTime #Feedback
Systems often involving feedback loops where a controller unit adjusts variables based on input from a processing unit. Common in real-time and embedded systems.
### Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) #Pattern #Asynchronous #Events
While distinct, EDA shares similarities. Systems react to events (significant occurrences or state changes). Flow architectures often implement or interact with EDA components (producers, consumers, brokers). Events trigger flows.
### Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) #Pattern #Messaging #Decoupling
Decouples message producers (publishers) from consumers (subscribers) via a message broker or event bus. Often used within flow architectures for communication.
### Streaming Architecture #Pattern #RealTime #DataStreams
Designed for continuous, real-time processing of unbounded data streams. Flow patterns are central to stream processing.
### Workflow Orchestration #Pattern #ControlFlow #Coordination
Managing complex, multi-step processes involving multiple services or components, often with conditional logic, error handling, and state management.
### Saga Pattern #Pattern #Transactions #DistributedSystems
Manages data consistency across multiple services in distributed systems without relying on distributed transactions, often used in orchestrated or choreographed flows.

## Core Components #BuildingBlocks #Elements
Standard elements found in flow architectures.
### Sources/Producers #Input #DataOrigin
Components that introduce data into the flow (e.g., sensors, databases, APIs, message queues).
### Sinks/Consumers #Output #DataDestination
Components that receive data at the end of a flow or branch (e.g., databases, APIs, UI, file storage).
### Processors/Filters/Transformers #Processing #Logic
Components that modify, enrich, filter, aggregate, or otherwise transform the data flowing through them.
### Channels/Pipes/Queues #Communication #Transport
The conduits for data movement between components. Can be simple connections or buffered queues/message brokers.
### Routers/Dispatchers #ControlFlow #Logic
Components that direct the flow of data based on content or rules (e.g., splitting, merging, conditional routing).
### Orchestrators/Coordinators #ControlFlow #Management
Centralized components that manage the execution sequence, state, and error handling of complex flows (common in workflow patterns).
### Registries/Repositories #Configuration #Management
Storage for flow definitions, component metadata, and configuration.

## Comparisons and Relationships #Comparison #Context
How flow architecture relates to other architectural concepts.
### vs. Request-Response Architecture #Comparison #Synchronous
Contrasting with traditional synchronous client-server communication. Flow is often asynchronous and data/event-driven.
### vs. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) #Comparison #Events
Flow architecture often utilizes EDA patterns (like pub/sub) but focuses more on the explicit path and transformation of data/tasks, whereas EDA focuses on reacting to discrete events. They are often complementary.
### vs. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) #Comparison #Services
SOA focuses on reusable services, while flow architecture focuses on the movement and processing between components (which could be services). EDA can be seen as a more decoupled evolution compared to traditional SOA request-response.
### vs. Microservices Architecture #Comparison #Microservices
Flow architectures are often used *within* or *between* microservices to handle data processing and communication. Microservices enable building complex flows with independently deployable components.
