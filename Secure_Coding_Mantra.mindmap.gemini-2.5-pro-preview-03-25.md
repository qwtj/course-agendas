# Secure Coding Mantra #Security #Development #Principles
This mind map outlines the core concepts, practices, and philosophy behind writing secure software, often summarized by various "secure coding mantras."

## Core Principles & The Mantra #Philosophy #Guidelines #Mindset
Fundamental ideas and attitudes underpinning secure software development.
These principles form the basis of a secure coding culture.

### Secure by Design #Proactive #Architecture #Foundation
Building security into the software from the very beginning of the design phase.
Requires thinking about security requirements alongside functional requirements.

### Secure Defaults #Configuration #FailSafe #Usability
Ensuring the default configuration of the software is the most secure option.
Users must explicitly choose less secure settings if needed.

### Defense in Depth #LayeredSecurity #Redundancy #Mitigation
Implementing multiple layers of security controls.
If one layer fails, others can still protect the system.

### Principle of Least Privilege #Authorization #AccessControl #Minimization
Granting users, processes, or components only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their intended function.
Reduces the potential impact of a compromised component.

### Fail Securely #ErrorHandling #Resilience #StateManagement
Ensuring that if a system component fails, it does so in a way that does not compromise security.
Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages; maintain a secure state.

### Never Trust Input #InputValidation #Sanitization #InjectionPrevention
Treating all external input (from users, files, network, other systems) as potentially malicious.
Requires rigorous validation, sanitization, and encoding.

### Separation of Duties #Roles #Permissions #Accountability
Dividing critical functions among different roles or individuals.
Prevents a single point of compromise or failure.

### Keep it Simple #Simplicity #Complexity #AttackSurface
Avoiding unnecessary complexity in design and code.
Simpler systems are easier to understand, maintain, and secure. Reduces the attack surface.

### Assume Breach #ZeroTrust #Detection #Response
Operating under the assumption that breaches will occur.
Focuses on detection, response, and minimizing blast radius.

### Economy of Mechanism #Design #Simplicity #Verification
Keeping the design of security mechanisms as simple and small as possible.
Facilitates easier verification and reduces chances of flaws.

## Input Validation & Output Encoding #DataHandling #InjectionPrevention #XSS
Techniques to handle data safely as it enters and leaves the application.

### Input Validation Techniques #Allowlisting #Blocklisting #TypeChecking
Methods to ensure data conforms to expected formats, types, lengths, and ranges.
Prefer allow-listing (defining what is allowed) over block-listing (defining what is disallowed).

#### Data Type Validation #Integers #Strings #Booleans
Ensuring data matches the expected primitive type.

#### Range and Bounds Checking #Numeric #Length #Limits
Verifying data falls within acceptable minimum and maximum values or lengths.

#### Format Validation #Regex #Patterns #Structure
Checking if data conforms to a specific structure (e.g., email address, date format) using regular expressions or other means.

#### Canonicalization #Normalization #Equivalence #PathTraversal
Converting input data into its simplest or standard form before validation to prevent bypassing checks (e.g., decoding URL-encoded characters).

### Output Encoding #CrossSiteScripting #XSS #ContextualEncoding
Encoding data before displaying it to the user or sending it to another system to prevent interpretation as active content (e.g., HTML, JavaScript).
Encoding must be context-aware (HTML body, HTML attribute, JavaScript, CSS, URL).

#### HTML Encoding #Entities #WebBrowsers
Converting characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"` to their HTML entity equivalents.

#### JavaScript Encoding #ScriptContext #DataEmbedding
Encoding data placed within JavaScript code blocks.

#### URL Encoding #QueryStrings #Paths
Encoding special characters within URLs.

#### CSS Encoding #StyleContext #DataEmbedding
Encoding data used within Cascading Style Sheets.

### Preventing Injection Flaws #SQLi #OSCommand #LDAP

#### Parameterized Queries / Prepared Statements #SQLInjection #DatabaseSecurity
Using database mechanisms that separate query logic from user-supplied data.

#### Safe API Usage #OSCommandInjection #SystemCalls
