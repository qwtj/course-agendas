# Threat Modeling Methodologies: STRIDE & DREAD #ThreatModeling #Cybersecurity #RiskManagement
Overview of threat modeling concepts with a focus on the STRIDE and DREAD methodologies.

## Introduction to Threat Modeling #Fundamentals #Overview #Process
Establishes the foundational knowledge required to understand threat modeling and its context.
### Definition and Purpose #Goals #Scope
What threat modeling is and why it's performed. Aims to systematically identify, assess, and mitigate potential security threats.
### Importance in SDLC #DevSecOps #SecureDevelopment
Integrating threat modeling into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) to build more secure systems from the start.
### Key Goals #Objectives #Outcomes
Primary objectives: Identifying potential threats, understanding vulnerabilities, assessing risks, prioritizing mitigation efforts, and informing security decisions.
### Common Threat Modeling Steps #Workflow #Lifecycle
General phases: Defining scope, modeling the system (e.g., using DFDs), identifying threats, assessing risks, planning mitigations, and validating results.

## The STRIDE Methodology #STRIDE #ThreatIdentification #Microsoft
Detailed exploration of the STRIDE methodology, developed by Microsoft for identifying computer security threats.
### History and Origin #Microsoft #Development
Developed by Loren Kohnfelder and Praerit Garg at Microsoft in the late 1990s.
### Core Concepts #Principles #Framework
Based on categorizing threats according to the type of security property they violate.
### Breakdown of STRIDE Categories #ThreatTypes #Classification
Detailed examination of each category within the STRIDE acronym.
#### Spoofing #Authentication #Identity
Pretending to be something or someone else (e.g., user, process, system). Violates Authentication.
#### Tampering #Integrity #DataModification
Unauthorized modification of data or code. Violates Integrity.
#### Repudiation #NonRepudiation #Accountability
Denying having performed an action when others can prove otherwise, or the inability to prove an action occurred. Violates Non-Repudiation.
#### Information Disclosure #Confidentiality #DataLeak
Exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized individuals. Violates Confidentiality.
#### Denial of Service #Availability #DoS
Preventing legitimate users from accessing a system or service. Violates Availability.
#### Elevation of Privilege #Authorization #AccessControl
Gaining capabilities or permissions beyond those initially granted. Violates Authorization.
### Applying STRIDE #HowTo #Implementation
Techniques for systematically applying STRIDE categories to system components (e.g., processes, data flows, data stores). Often involves mapping STRIDE to elements in a Data Flow Diagram (DFD).
### Strengths and Weaknesses #ProsCons #Evaluation
Benefits (e.g., structured approach, comprehensive categories) and limitations (e.g., can be abstract, may miss certain threat types).

## The DREAD Methodology #DREAD #RiskAssessment #ThreatRating
Detailed exploration of the DREAD methodology, used for rating and prioritizing identified threats.
### History and Origin #Microsoft #RiskCalculation
Also developed at Microsoft as a way to quantify and compare the risk associated with different threats.
### Purpose: Risk Rating and Prioritization #Ranking #Scoring
Aims to provide a numerical score to help prioritize which threats require the most urgent attention and mitigation efforts.
### Breakdown of DREAD Components #RiskFactors #Criteria
Detailed examination of each factor used in the DREAD calculation.
#### Damage Potential #Impact #Consequences
How severe would the damage be if the threat were exploited? (e.g., financial loss, data loss, reputational damage).
#### Reproducibility #Consistency #Reliability
How easy is it to consistently reproduce the exploit?
#### Exploitability #Effort #SkillRequired
How much effort, skill, or resources are needed to exploit the vulnerability?
#### Affected Users #Scope #Scale
How many users or systems would be impacted if the exploit occurs? (e.g., percentage, absolute number).
#### Discoverability #Likelihood #Detection
How easy is it for an attacker to find the vulnerability?
### DREAD Calculation/Scoring #Quantification #RiskFormula
Common methods involve assigning a score (e.g., 1-3 or 1-10) to each DREAD factor and then combining them (e.g., summing, averaging) to get an overall risk rating. Risk = (D + R + E + A + D) / 5 is a common formula.
### Subjectivity Issues and Criticisms #Limitations #Drawbacks
DREAD ratings can be highly subjective and vary significantly between assessors, leading to inconsistent prioritization. This is a major reason its use has declined.
### Use Cases for DREAD #ApplicationScenarios #HistoricalContext
Historically used alongside STRIDE for prioritizing security bug fixes and mitigation efforts.

## Integrating STRIDE and DREAD #CombinedApproach #Workflow #Prioritization
Using STRIDE and DREAD together in the threat modeling process.
### Typical Workflow #ProcessFlow #Sequence
Identify threats using STRIDE first, then rate the identified threats using DREAD.
### Mapping STRIDE Threats to DREAD Ratings #Correlation #Assessment
Applying the DREAD criteria (Damage, Reproducibility, etc.) to each specific threat identified through STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, etc.).
### Benefits of Combined Use #Synergy #Value
Provides a structured way to both identify a broad range of threats (STRIDE) and then attempt to prioritize them based on perceived risk (DREAD).
### Challenges in Integration #Difficulties #Complexity
Requires careful application, and the inherent subjectivity of DREAD can undermine the prioritization process.

## Threat Modeling Process using STRIDE/DREAD #PracticalApplication #Workflow #Implementation
A step-by-step guide to conducting a threat modeling exercise using these methodologies.
### Defining Scope and Objectives #Preparation #Context
Clearly outlining what system components are included and excluded, and defining the goals of the exercise.
### Modeling the Application/System #Diagramming #DataFlowDiagrams #DFD
Creating a visual representation of the system architecture and data flows.
#### Process Boundaries #Components #Executables
Identifying running code or processes.
#### Data Flows #Communication #Protocols

#### Data Stores #Databases #Files #Storage
Where data resides at rest.
#### External Interactors #Users #Systems

#### Trust Boundaries #SecurityZones #Perimeter
Lines where the level of trust changes (e.g., between user input and backend processing).
### Identifying Threats (Applying STRIDE) #ThreatElicitation #Brainstorming
Systematically examining each element of the model (processes, flows, stores) against each STRIDE category to identify potential threats.
#### Mapping STRIDE to DFD Elements #AnalysisTechnique #SystematicReview
Applying STRIDE questions to each component and interaction shown in the DFD.
### Rating Threats (Applying DREAD) #RiskCalculation #Prioritization
Assigning DREAD scores (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability) to each identified threat.
#### Assigning DREAD Scores #SubjectiveAssessment #RatingScale
The process of evaluating each threat against the DREAD criteria using a defined scale (e.g., 1-10).
#### Calculating Overall Risk #Aggregation #FinalScore
Combining individual factor scores into a single risk rating for prioritization.
### Identifying Mitigations #Countermeasures #SecurityControls

## Limitations and Criticisms #Challenges #Drawbacks #Alternatives
Discussing the shortcomings of STRIDE and particularly DREAD.
### Subjectivity of DREAD #RatingIssues #ConsistencyProblem
The primary criticism: DREAD scores are highly subjective and depend heavily on the assessor's perspective and experience.
#### Reasons for Deprecation/Decline #Obsolescence #Replacement
Many organizations have moved away from DREAD towards more objective or context-specific risk rating systems (e.g., CVSS, custom matrices).
### Scope Limitations of STRIDE #Completeness #ContextSpecific
While broad, STRIDE might not cover all relevant threat types, especially business logic flaws or more complex attack chains.
### Focus on Technical vs. Business Risks #Perspective #Bias
STRIDE/DREAD tend to focus more on technical vulnerabilities than broader business impacts or organizational risks.
### Scalability Challenges #LargeSystems #ComplexityManagement
