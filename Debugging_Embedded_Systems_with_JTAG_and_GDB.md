    *   "<prompt> Emphasize the importance of using version control systems (like Git) not only for application code but also for GDB scripts, OpenOCD configuration files, and related build/debug setup information."
*   ### Logging and Assertions in Code
    *   "<prompt> Recommend building robust logging mechanisms (e.g., UART logging, ITM trace, or logging to memory buffers) and using assertions (`assert()`) within the embedded code itself to proactively catch errors and provide diagnostic information, reducing reliance on interactive debugging."
*   ### Maintaining Clear Documentation of Debug Setup
    *   "<prompt> Stress the need for documenting the specific hardware setup, JTAG adapter, GDB server version, configuration files, and steps required to reproduce the debug environment, especially in team settings."
*   **Glossary:**
    *   *   "<prompt> Define 'RTOS' (Real-Time Operating System)."
    *   *   "<prompt> Define 'Post-mortem Debugging'."
    *   *   "<prompt> Define 'Trace' in the context of hardware debugging (e.g., ITM/ETM)."
    *   *   "<prompt> Define 'Assertion' as used in programming."
*   **Quiz:**
    *   "<prompt> Create a final quiz (4-5 questions) covering topics like GDB scripting benefits, RTOS-aware debugging concepts (`info threads`), the concept of post-mortem debugging, the impact of debugging on timing, and key best practices (version control, logging/assertions)."
*   **Summary:**
    *   "<prompt> Write a brief concluding summary (2-3 sentences) for Section VI, reviewing the importance of optimizing the debug workflow, techniques for complex scenarios (RTOS, timing), awareness of performance impacts, and adherence to best practices like scripting, logging, and documentation."
*   **Reflective Prompt:**
    *   *   "<prompt> Generate a reflective question prompting the learner to synthesize the knowledge gained throughout the agenda. Ask them to consider a hypothetical complex embedded bug (e.g., intermittent data corruption possibly related to an ISR) and describe how they would approach debugging it using the combination of JTAG hardware access, GDB software control, OpenOCD, and the various techniques learned (breakpoints, watchpoints, register inspection, stack analysis, possibly trace)."
