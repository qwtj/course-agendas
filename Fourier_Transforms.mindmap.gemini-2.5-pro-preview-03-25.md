# Fourier Transforms #Overview #MathematicalTool
Mathematical technique transforming a function (often time-dependent) into its constituent frequencies. It reveals the frequency spectrum of a signal. Named after Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier.

## Introduction and History #Basics #Context
Brief overview and historical development.

### What is a Fourier Transform? #Definition #Concept
It decomposes a function or signal into a sum or integral of sines and cosines (or complex exponentials) of different frequencies. Transforms from the time/spatial domain to the frequency domain.

### Historical Context #History #Fourier
Developed by Joseph Fourier in the early 19th century, initially for studying heat conduction. Led to Fourier Series for periodic functions, later generalized to the Fourier Transform for non-periodic functions.

### Time Domain vs. Frequency Domain #Concept #Representation
Time domain shows signal amplitude over time. Frequency domain shows the amplitude (and phase) of each frequency present in the signal.

## Mathematical Foundations #Theory #Mathematics
Core mathematical principles underlying Fourier Transforms.

### Periodic Functions and Fourier Series #FourierSeries #PeriodicSignals
Periodic functions can be represented as an infinite sum of sines and cosines with discrete frequencies (harmonics). This is the basis from which the Fourier Transform for non-periodic functions is derived.
#### Complex Exponential Form #Representation #ComplexNumbers
Using Euler's formula (e^(ix) = cos(x) + i sin(x)) to represent sinusoids compactly.
#### Convergence Properties #Analysis #Theory
Conditions under which the Fourier series converges to the original function (e.g., Dirichlet conditions, Gibbs phenomenon).

### Complex Numbers and Euler's Formula #ComplexAnalysis #Euler
Essential for the compact and standard representation of Fourier Transforms. The transform output is generally complex-valued.

### Integral Transforms #MathematicalTool #Integral
The Fourier Transform is a type of integral transform, mapping one function space to another.

### Orthogonality #BasisFunctions #LinearAlgebra
The sine and cosine functions (or complex exponentials) form an orthogonal basis for function spaces like L² (square-integrable functions). This orthogonality allows for the decomposition and reconstruction of signals.

### Function Spaces (L¹, L², Tempered Distributions) #Analysis #FunctionSpaces
The applicability and properties of the Fourier Transform depend on the space the function belongs to (e.g., Lebesgue integrable L¹, square-integrable L², or generalized functions/distributions like the Dirac delta).

## Types of Fourier Transforms #Variations #Classification
Different versions of the transform based on the nature of the signal (continuous/discrete, periodic/aperiodic).

### Continuous-Time Fourier Transform (CTFT) #ContinuousTime #AnalogSignals
Transforms continuous-time, aperiodic signals x(t) into continuous-frequency spectra X(ω) or X(f).
#### Definition #Formula #CTFT
X(ω) = ∫[-∞, ∞] x(t) * e^(-iωt) dt
#### Inverse CTFT #Formula #Reconstruction
x(t) = (1/2π) ∫[-∞, ∞] X(ω) * e^(iωt) dω
(Note: Normalization constants may vary)

### Fourier Series (FS) #PeriodicSignals #DiscreteFrequency
Represents continuous-time, periodic signals x(t) as a sum of complex exponentials at discrete frequencies (harmonics nω₀).
#### Analysis Equation (Coefficients) #Formula #FS
c_n = (1/T) ∫[T] x(t) * e^(-inω₀t) dt
#### Synthesis Equation (Reconstruction) #Formula #FS
x(t) = Σ[n=-∞, ∞] c_n * e^(inω₀t)

### Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) #DiscreteTime #DigitalSignals
Transforms discrete-time, aperiodic signals x[n] into continuous, periodic frequency spectra X(Ω) or X(e^(iω)).
#### Definition #Formula #DTFT
X(Ω) = Σ[n=-∞, ∞] x[n] * e^(-iΩn)
#### Inverse DTFT #Formula #Reconstruction
x[n] = (1/2π) ∫[-π, π] X(Ω) * e^(iΩn) dΩ
#### Periodicity of Spectrum #Property #DTFT
The DTFT spectrum X(Ω) is always periodic with period 2π.

### Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) #DiscreteTime #Computation
Transforms discrete-time, finite-length (or periodic) signals x[n] (length N) into discrete-frequency spectra X[k] (length N). This is the version implemented computationally.
#### Definition #Formula #DFT
X[k] = Σ[n=0, N-1] x[n] * e^(-i * 2π * k * n / N) for k = 0, ..., N-1
#### Inverse DFT (IDFT) #Formula #Reconstruction
x[n] = (1/N) Σ[k=0, N-1] X[k] * e^(i * 2π * k * n / N) for n = 0, ..., N-1

### Relationships Between Transforms #Connections #Theory
How the four main types relate to each other through sampling, periodization, and limiting processes.

### Fourier Sine and Cosine Transforms #SpecialCases #Symmetry
Simplified transforms for functions with specific symmetry (odd or even functions).

## Properties of Fourier Transforms #Characteristics #Rules
Fundamental properties that simplify analysis and manipulation in the frequency domain. (Properties often apply across different FT types, sometimes with minor modifications).

### Linearity #Fundamental #Superposition
F{a*f(t) + b*g(t)} = a*F{f(t)} + b*F{g(t)}

### Time Shifting #Translation #PhaseShift
F{f(t - t₀)} = e^(-iωt₀) * F(ω)
A shift in time corresponds to a linear phase shift in frequency.

### Frequency Shifting (Modulation) #Modulation #FrequencyTranslation
F{e^(iω₀t) * f(t)} = F(ω - ω₀)
Multiplication by a complex exponential in time corresponds to a shift in frequency.

### Time Scaling #Compression #Expansion
F{f(at)} = (1/|a|) * F(ω/a)
Compression in time leads to expansion in frequency, and vice versa.

### Duality (Symmetry) #Symmetry #Reciprocity
If F{f(t)} = F(ω), then F{F(t)} = 2π * f(-ω) (exact form depends on FT definition conventions).

### Convolution Theorem #Convolution #Filtering
F{f(t) * g(t)} = F(ω) * G(ω) (where * denotes convolution)
Convolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the frequency domain.

### Multiplication Theorem #Multiplication #ConvolutionFrequency
F{f(t) * g(t)} = (1/2π) * (F(ω) * G(ω)) (where * denotes convolution)
Multiplication in the time domain becomes convolution in the frequency domain (scaled).

### Differentiation Property #Calculus #HighFrequency
F{dⁿf(t)/dtⁿ} = (iω)ⁿ * F(ω)
Differentiation in time emphasizes higher frequencies.

### Integration Property #Calculus #LowFrequency
F{∫[-∞, t] f(τ) dτ} = (1/iω) * F(ω) + πF(0)δ(ω) (exact form varies)
Integration in time emphasizes lower frequencies.

### Parseval's Theorem / Plancherel Theorem #Energy #Power
∫[-∞, ∞] |f(t)|² dt = (1/2π) ∫[-∞, ∞] |F(ω)|² dω (exact form depends on FT definition)
Relates the energy/power of the signal in the time domain to its energy/power in the frequency domain. Energy is conserved.

### Conjugation and Symmetry Properties #Symmetry #RealSignals
Properties related to complex conjugation and implications for real-valued signals (e.g., conjugate symmetry: F(-ω) = F*(ω) for real f(t)).
