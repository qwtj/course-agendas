**Learning Objectives**: Understand audio principles from recording to mastering, including synthesis and advanced techniques.

**Prerequisites**: Basic computer literacy, familiarity with audio playback devices.

**Depth & Scope**: Intermediate; covers a wide range of audio topics but may require further exploration for specialized applications.

**Target Audience**: Musicians, audio engineers, sound designers, and hobbyists.

**Technical Details**:
*   **Gain Staging**: Adjust preamp input until the signal peaks around -18dBFS.
*   **EQ**: Use a high-pass filter to remove unwanted low-frequency rumble below 80Hz.
*   **Compression**: Apply a 4:1 ratio with a medium attack and release to vocals for consistent levels.
*   **Reverb**: Set a decay time of 1.5 seconds for a medium-sized room reverb.
*   **Sidechain**: Route a kick drum to compress a bassline for rhythmic effect.
*   **LUFS**: Aim for -14 LUFS integrated loudness for streaming platforms.
*   **Nyquist Theorem**: Sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency to be recorded. Example: 44.1 kHz captures up to 22.05 kHz.
*   **ADSR Envelope**: Set ADSR to A:10ms, D:200ms, S: -12dB, R: 500ms for a synth pluck sound.

**Relevant Technologies/Tools**: DAWs (e.g., Ableton Live, Logic Pro, Pro Tools), plugins (EQ, compressors, reverbs), synthesizers (virtual and hardware).
