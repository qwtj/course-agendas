# Jupyter #ProjectJupyter #InteractiveComputing #OpenSource
Project Jupyter is an open-source initiative focused on developing software, standards, and services for interactive computing across various programming languages. It evolved from IPython in 2014.

## Core Concepts & Architecture #Basics #Architecture #Theory
Fundamental principles and structure of the Jupyter ecosystem.

### Two-Process Model #Kernel #Client #Decoupled
Jupyter operates on a model separating the client (user interface) from the kernel (code execution engine).
The client sends code to the kernel, which executes it and sends results back to the client for display.

### Kernel #CodeExecution #LanguageEngine
A separate process responsible for running user code in a specific language.
Handles computation, tab completion, introspection, and interactions with widgets.
Communicates with the client/server via ZeroMQ and WebSockets using a defined messaging protocol.

#### IPython Kernel #Python #DefaultKernel #IPykernel
The reference kernel for Python, built on IPython. Provides a powerful interactive Python environment.

#### Other Language Kernels #Polyglot #R #Julia
Kernels exist for dozens of other languages (e.g., R, Julia, Scala, C++, SQL, Haskell), enabling interactive computing beyond Python. Many are community-maintained.

#### Kernel Management #Lifecycle #Configuration
Starting, stopping, restarting kernels.
Managing multiple kernels for different environments or languages.
Kernel specification files (`kernel.json`) define how to start a kernel.

### Frontend (Client) #UserInterface #WebInterface
The user-facing application for interacting with kernels and notebooks.
Examples include Jupyter Notebook (classic), JupyterLab, Jupyter Console, QtConsole.
Responsible for rendering notebooks, handling user input, and displaying output.

### Jupyter Server #CommunicationHub #Backend
A backend server (often Tornado-based) that acts as a communication hub.
Connects the browser-based frontend, the on-disk notebook files, and the kernels.
Handles saving/loading notebooks, managing kernel lifecycles (via Kernel Manager), and routing messages.

#### Messaging Protocol #ZeroMQ #WebSockets #Communication
Defines how clients, the server, and kernels communicate using sockets (shell, control, IOPub, stdin, heartbeat).

### Notebook Document (.ipynb) #FileFormat #JSON #Persistence
The standard file format for storing Jupyter notebooks.
A JSON document containing code cells, markdown cells, raw cells, outputs, and metadata.
Self-contained record of computation, designed for sharing and reproducibility.

#### Cells #Code #Markdown #Raw
Building blocks of a notebook.
*   Code Cells: Contain executable code and their outputs.
*   Markdown Cells: Contain narrative text, equations (LaTeX via MathJax), images, etc.
*   Raw Cells: Unformatted text included as-is during conversion.

#### Metadata #Configuration #NotebookSettings
Information about the notebook and its environment (e.g., kernel information, language).

#### nbformat #Schema #Versioning
The official specification and schema for the `.ipynb` format.

## Jupyter User Interfaces #Frontend #Applications #UI

### Jupyter Notebook (Classic) #WebApp #NotebookInterface #Legacy
The original web-based interactive environment for creating and sharing notebook documents.
Features a document-oriented, single-notebook view.
