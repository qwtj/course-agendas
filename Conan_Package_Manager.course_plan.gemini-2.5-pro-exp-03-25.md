"Starting with H3, outline key recommendations for creating high-quality Conan packages, covering aspects like clear metadata, robust build logic, testing (`test_package`), and considering consumers. Reference 'Best Practices and Troubleshooting'."

## Managing Binary Compatibility
"Starting with H3, discuss strategies for handling ABI compatibility challenges, including careful management of compiler versions, C++ standard libraries (libstdc++, libc++), and relevant settings/options. Reference 'Best Practices and Troubleshooting'. Add a cross-reference note pointing back to 'Package IDs and Binary Compatibility' in 'Advanced Features' (Section IX)."

## Reproducible Builds
"Starting with H3, emphasize the importance of reproducible builds in C/C++ development and how Conan features like lockfiles and revisions help achieve this goal. Reference 'Best Practices and Troubleshooting'. Add a cross-reference note pointing back to 'Lockfiles' in 'Advanced Features' (Section IX)."

## CI/CD Integration
"Starting with H3, discuss common patterns and considerations for integrating Conan into Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, including caching strategies, profile management, and artifact promotion. Reference 'Best Practices and Troubleshooting'."

## Common Pitfalls
"Starting with H3, list some frequently encountered issues when using Conan (e.g., inconsistent profiles, ABI mismatches, complex dependency conflicts, environment contamination) and suggest ways to avoid them. Reference 'Best Practices and Troubleshooting'."

## Debugging Recipes
"Starting with H3, provide techniques for debugging problems within `conanfile.py` execution, such as using print statements, leveraging Conan's verbose output (`-v`), and understanding the execution flow of recipe methods. Reference 'Best Practices and Troubleshooting'."

## Performance Considerations
"Starting with H3, discuss factors affecting Conan performance, such as network speed, build times, and cache efficiency. Mention techniques like using `--build=missing` judiciously, optimizing recipes, and potentially utilizing Conan's download cache or Artifactory's caching capabilities. Reference 'Best Practices and Troubleshooting'."

## Conan 1.x vs Conan 2.0
"Starting with H3, highlight the key conceptual differences and improvements introduced in Conan 2.0 compared to Conan 1.x (e.g., generators, `layout()`, context model, command changes). Mention the importance of understanding these differences for migration or working in mixed environments. Reference 'Best Practices and Troubleshooting'."

*   "Generate a concise summary of best practices for robust Conan usage, focusing on reproducibility, CI/CD integration, and effective troubleshooting techniques, starting with a paragraph."
*   "Create a short quiz (3-5 questions) covering the role of lockfiles in reproducibility, strategies for managing ABI, and methods for debugging recipes, starting with H3."
*   "Generate a reflective prompt asking the learner to identify one best practice they will prioritize implementing in their future Conan usage and explain why, based on the 'Best Practices and Troubleshooting' section, starting with H3."

# XIII. Advanced Error Handling and Debugging

*   "Generate learning objectives focused on implementing robust error management in recipes and diagnosing complex Conan execution scenarios, starting with H2."

## Robust Error Management
"Starting with H3, explain best practices for handling potential errors within Conan recipes (`conanfile.py`), such as validating settings/options, using Python's exception handling (`try...except`), and providing informative error messages using `ConanInvalidConfiguration`. Reference 'Advanced Error Handling and Debugging'."

## Debugging Complex Scenarios
"Starting with H3, provide techniques and tools for diagnosing challenging Conan problems that go beyond simple recipe errors. Include tips like: analyzing dependency graphs (`conan graph info`), inspecting Conan cache contents, examining generated build system files, using verbose logs (`-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`), and isolating issues by simplifying the build environment or recipe. Reference 'Advanced Error Handling and Debugging'."

*   "Generate a concise summary of techniques for advanced error handling and debugging complex Conan issues, starting with a paragraph."
*   "Create a short quiz (2-3 questions) asking about handling invalid configurations in recipes and methods for investigating dependency graph issues, starting with H3."
*   "Generate a reflective prompt asking the learner to describe a systematic approach they would take to debug a failing `conan install` command where the error message is unclear, based on the 'Advanced Error Handling and Debugging' section, starting with H3."
