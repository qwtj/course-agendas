"<prompt>Explain the purpose of stress testing (pushing the system to its limits) and load testing (simulating realistic or heavy workloads) for RTOS applications. Discuss how these tests can reveal latent bugs like race conditions, deadlocks, memory leaks, or performance issues under pressure.</prompt>"

**Section V Summary:**
"<prompt>Provide a summary of Section V, covering the implementation of robust error handling (task and system level), techniques for debugging difficult RTOS-specific issues (deadlocks, race conditions, stack overflows) using appropriate tools, and strategies for effectively testing the migrated RTOS application (unit, integration, stress testing).</prompt>"

**Glossary for Section V:**
*   `Watchdog Timer`: "<prompt>Define 'Watchdog Timer' (hardware or software) and its role in system recovery.</prompt>"
*   `Assertion (`assert()`)`: "<prompt>Define 'Assertion' (`assert()`) as a debugging and error detection mechanism.</prompt>"
*   `Error Hook`: "<prompt>Define 'Error Hook' (e.g., Malloc Failed Hook, Stack Overflow Hook) provided by an RTOS.</prompt>"
*   `Deadlock`: "<prompt>Define 'Deadlock' in the context of concurrent resource access in an RTOS.</prompt>"

**Quiz for Section V:**
"<prompt>Generate 4-5 scenario-based or multiple-choice questions testing understanding of error handling strategies (watchdogs, hooks), debugging techniques for deadlocks/race conditions/stack overflows, and the different levels of testing (unit, integration, stress) relevant to RTOS applications, as covered in Section V.</prompt>"

**Reflection Prompt for Section V:**
"<prompt>Generate a reflective prompt asking the learner to consider potential failure modes or complex bugs that might arise in their migrated application and how the error handling, debugging, and testing techniques learned in Section V could be applied to mitigate or diagnose them.</prompt>"

# VI. Final Steps and Best Practices
*   **Learning Objectives:** Understand the final validation process, appreciate the importance of documentation and maintainability for RTOS projects, and recognize common mistakes made during migration to avoid them.

## Final Integration and Validation
"<prompt>Describe the final stage of the migration project, focusing on ensuring the complete system works as intended and meets all original and new requirements.</prompt>"

### System-Level Testing Against Requirements
"<prompt>Explain the process of conducting comprehensive system-level tests on the fully migrated RTOS application. Emphasize testing against the functional and non-functional (especially real-time) requirements defined at the start of the project (*See Section I.C*).</prompt>"

### Ensuring Real-Time Constraints are Met
"<prompt>Discuss methods for verifying that the critical real-time deadlines identified earlier (*See Section I.C.ii*) are consistently met under various operating conditions. This may involve using profiling tools (*See Section IV.D*), logic analyzers, or specific test harnesses to measure response times and jitter.</prompt>"

## Documentation and Maintenance
"<prompt>Highlight the increased importance of thorough documentation and considering long-term maintainability for more complex RTOS-based systems compared to simpler bare-metal code.</prompt>"

### Documenting RTOS Design Choices
"<prompt>Stress the need to document key RTOS design decisions: task decomposition rationale, priority assignments, choice of ITC mechanisms, memory management strategy, interrupt handling approach, and justification for any optimizations. Explain why this is crucial for future understanding and modification.</prompt>"

### Long-Term Maintainability Considerations
"<prompt>Discuss factors impacting the long-term maintainability of the migrated RTOS firmware. Include code structure/modularity, consistent coding style, use of abstractions (HAL), version control practices, and the aforementioned documentation.</prompt>"

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
"<prompt>Summarize common mistakes encountered during bare-metal to RTOS migrations to help learners anticipate and avoid them.</prompt>"

### Examples of Common Migration Mistakes
"<prompt>List and briefly explain common pitfalls, such as: incorrect priority assignment leading to inversion or starvation, non-thread-safe drivers or library usage causing race conditions, improper ISR design (too long, calling blocking functions), memory issues (stack overflows, fragmentation, leaks), inefficient use of ITC, underestimating testing effort, and poor documentation.</prompt>"
> **Key Point:** "<prompt>Generate a final concluding statement emphasizing that a successful migration requires not just understanding RTOS APIs, but careful design, systematic implementation, and thorough testing.</prompt>"
