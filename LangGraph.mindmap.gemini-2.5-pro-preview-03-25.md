# LangGraph #Framework #Agents #Workflows
LangGraph is a library within the LangChain ecosystem designed for building stateful, multi-actor applications using Large Language Models (LLMs). It allows developers to create complex agentic systems by representing workflows as graphs, particularly supporting cycles which are crucial for agent runtime behavior. LangGraph offers more control and flexibility compared to standard LangChain agent executors, especially for bespoke, intricate tasks. It focuses on orchestration, state management, and coordination between different components (LLMs, tools, human inputs) in a structured manner.

## Introduction and Core Concepts #Overview #Fundamentals #Motivation
Provides a foundational understanding of LangGraph, its purpose, and core ideas.
LangGraph is an open-source (MIT licensed), low-level orchestration framework for building potentially complex applications with LLMs, often involving multiple steps, agents, or decision points. It extends LangChain's capabilities by enabling the creation of graphs with cycles, essential for sophisticated agent behavior.

### What is LangGraph? #Definition #Purpose
LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, focusing on creating graph structures that can include cycles. It's part of the LangChain ecosystem but can be used independently.

### Why Use LangGraph? #Benefits #Motivation
*   **Complex Workflows:** Handles intricate logic, branching, and loops that are difficult with linear chains.
*   **Agentic Systems:** Ideal for building autonomous agents and multi-agent systems that require planning, reflection, and tool use cycles.
*   **State Management:** Provides built-in mechanisms for managing persistent state across graph steps.
*   **Control & Flexibility:** Offers fine-grained control over the execution flow compared to higher-level agent frameworks.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** Easily integrates human feedback and intervention points.
*   **Debugging & Visualization:** Integrates with LangSmith for tracing and visualization of complex flows.

### Core Concepts Overview #Basics #Terminology
*   **Graph:** The fundamental structure representing the application's workflow.
*   **Nodes:** Represent units of computation (functions or LangChain Runnables) that perform actions.
*   **Edges:** Define the connections and flow of control between nodes.
*   **State:** A shared object passed between nodes, holding the application's current information.
*   **Cycles:** The ability for the graph execution to loop back to previous nodes, enabling iterative processes.

### Comparison with LangChain #Differences #Positioning
*   **LangChain:** Focuses on composing components (LLMs, retrievers, tools) often in linear sequences (DAGs - Directed Acyclic Graphs) using the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL). Higher-level abstractions like Agents are provided but can be less flexible for custom cycles.
*   **LangGraph:** Explicitly designed for graph structures, including cycles (cyclic graphs). Provides lower-level control over state and flow, making it better suited for complex, agentic systems where custom logic for looping and state updates is needed. LangChain provides standard interfaces while LangGraph is an orchestration framework.

## Key Abstractions and Architecture #CoreComponents #Design #Internals
Describes the main building blocks and design principles of LangGraph.

### StateGraph #GraphDefinition #StateMachine
The primary class for defining the structure of a LangGraph workflow. It acts as a state machine where nodes modify a shared state object.

### State #SharedData #Context #Persistence
*   **Definition:** The data structure (often a TypedDict or Pydantic model) that holds information passed between nodes. It represents the current snapshot of the application's progress and memory.
*   **Management:** LangGraph manages the passing and updating of the state object automatically based on node outputs.
*   **Persistence:** State can be saved (checkpointed) to allow for resuming workflows, error recovery, and long-running processes.

### Nodes #ComputationUnit #Function #Runnable
*   **Definition:** Python functions or LangChain Runnables that perform specific tasks (e.g., calling an LLM, executing a tool, processing data).
*   **Input/Output:** Receive the current state as input and return updates to the state.
*   **Types:** Can range from simple Python functions to complex LangChain chains or agents.

### Edges #ControlFlow #Transitions #Routing
*   **Definition:** Define the directed connections between nodes, determining the sequence of execution.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Normal Edges:** Unconditional transition from one node to the next.
    *   **Conditional Edges:** Route execution to different nodes based on the current state (evaluated by a function). This enables branching and looping.
    *   **START/END Edges:** Special edges defining the graph's entry point and termination points.

## Defining Graph Structure #BuildingBlocks #GraphConstruction #NodesEdges
Covers the practical steps of constructing a LangGraph workflow.

### Initializing StateGraph #Setup #Instantiation
Creating an instance of `StateGraph` and associating it with a state definition (e.g., `StateGraph(State)`).

### Adding Nodes #NodeRegistration #WorkflowSteps
Using `graph.add_node(node_name, node_function_or_runnable)` to register computational units within the graph.

### Adding Edges #ConnectingNodes #FlowDefinition
*   **Setting Entry Point:** `graph.set_entry_point(node_name)` defines the first node to execute.
*   **Adding Normal Edges:** `graph.add_edge(start_node_name, end_node_name)` creates a direct transition.
*   **Adding Conditional Edges:** `graph.add_conditional_edges(start_node_name, condition_function, path_map)` routes flow based on the output of `condition_function` which returns a key from `path_map`.
*   **Defining Finish Points:** Using `END` as the target in `add_edge` or conditional edge mappings to specify termination points.

### Compiling the Graph #Finalization #RunnableGraph
Using `graph.compile()` to finalize the graph definition and create a runnable LangChain object (often a `CompiledGraph`). Checkpointers can be added during compilation for persistence.

## State Management #StateFlow #DataPersistence #InformationHandling
Focuses on how information is stored, updated, and passed within the graph.

### Defining the State Schema #DataModel #TypedDict #Pydantic
Specifying the structure of the state object, often using Python's `TypedDict` or `Pydantic` models for type safety and clarity.

### Updating State in Nodes #StateModification #NodeOutput
Nodes return dictionaries containing the state keys they wish to update. LangGraph merges these updates into the overall state. Built-in helpers like `add_messages` handle common update patterns (e.g., appending to message lists).

### State Flow Between Nodes #DataPassing #ContextPropagation
The updated state from one node is automatically passed as input to the next node determined by the edges.

## Control Flow and Cycles #Logic #Routing #Loops #Conditionals
Explores how LangGraph manages complex execution paths, including loops.

### Conditional Routing #Branching #DecisionMaking
Using conditional edges (`add_conditional_edges`) to dynamically choose the next node based on the current state (e.g., LLM output, tool results, specific state flags).

### Implementing Cycles #Loops #Iteration #RevisitingNodes
Creating loops by defining edges (normal or conditional) that transition back to previously visited nodes. This is fundamental for agentic behaviors like planning-execution loops or reflection.

### Entry and Exit Points #StartNode #EndNode #Termination
Defining where the graph execution begins (`set_entry_point`) and the conditions under which it finishes (edges pointing to `END`).

## Building Agentic Systems #Agents #MultiAgent #AICollaboration
Discusses how LangGraph facilitates the creation of intelligent agents and multi-agent systems.

### Single Agent Architectures #ReAct #PlanExecute #SelfCorrection
Implementing common agent patterns like ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) or plan-and-execute by structuring nodes and edges to handle LLM reasoning, tool selection/execution, and observation processing within loops. Patterns like Corrective RAG (C-RAG) and Self-RAG can be implemented.

### Multi-Agent Systems #Collaboration #Hierarchy #Orchestration
Designing workflows where multiple agents (represented as nodes or subgraphs) collaborate, delegate tasks, or operate in parallel. LangGraph manages the state and communication flow between them. Examples include hierarchical agents or debate-style systems.

### Memory Implementation #ConversationHistory #ContextRetention
Using the graph's state to store conversation history, intermediate results, or agent scratchpads. Checkpointers allow for persistent memory across interactions.

## Tool Integration and Usage #ExternalCalls #APIs #FunctionCalling
Connecting LangGraph workflows to external tools and data sources.

### Defining Tools #LangChainTools #CustomFunctions
Using standard LangChain tools or defining custom Python functions as tools.

### Binding Tools to LLMs #ToolCallingSetup #LLMIntegration
Making LLMs aware of available tools, often using methods like `.bind_tools()` on the LLM instance within a node.

### Tool Execution Nodes #ToolNode #ActionExecution
Creating specific nodes (e.g., using `ToolNode`) responsible for executing the tool calls requested by an LLM node and returning the results to the state. Conditional edges are often used to route between LLM nodes and tool execution nodes.

## Execution and Invocation #RunningGraphs #Compilation #Interface
How to run and interact with a compiled LangGraph.

### Compiling the Graph #RunnableInstance #Checkpointers
The `.compile()` method transforms the graph definition into an executable object. Optional `checkpointer` argument enables state persistence.

### Invoking the Graph #RunningWorkflow #InputOutput
Using methods like `.invoke(input, config)` to run the graph with initial input. The `config` argument is used for things like specifying thread IDs for persistence (`{"configurable": {"thread_id": "..."}}`).

### Streaming Results #RealTimeOutput #IntermediateSteps
LangGraph supports streaming intermediate results from nodes as they execute, allowing for more responsive applications. This includes streaming node outputs or state updates.

## Persistence and Checkpointing #SavingState #Resilience #LongRunning
Enables saving and resuming graph state.

### Checkpointers #StateSaving #PersistenceBackend
Objects responsible for saving and loading the graph's state (e.g., `MemorySaver`, database-backed savers). They are typically passed during graph compilation.

### Enabling Persistence #Configuration #ThreadID
Associating specific executions with a unique identifier (e.g., `thread_id` in the config) so the checkpointer knows which state history to load and save.

### Use Cases #ResumingWorkflows #FaultTolerance #Memory
*   **Long-running tasks:** Pause and resume workflows.
*   **Memory:** Maintain conversation history or agent state across multiple interactions.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Resume from the last saved state after interruptions.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** Pause execution for human input and resume afterward.
*   **Time Travel:** Replay or modify past states (see Advanced Topics).

## Human-in-the-Loop Workflows #UserInteraction #Feedback #Supervision
