# Project Management Methodologies #Overview #Frameworks #Lifecycle
An introduction to the structured approaches used to guide projects from conception to completion. Methodologies provide frameworks, processes, tools, and techniques.

## Introduction to Project Management Methodologies #Fundamentals #Definition #Purpose
Defines what project management methodologies are, their importance, and the common goals they aim to achieve (e.g., structure, efficiency, risk management).

### What is a Methodology? #Concept #Definition
Distinguishing methodology from framework, standard, and process.

### Importance of Using a Methodology #Benefits #ValueProposition
Discusses consistency, predictability, improved communication, risk reduction, quality management, and stakeholder satisfaction.

### Common Goals Across Methodologies #Objectives #Aims
Efficiency, clarity, control, adaptability, value delivery.

## Classification of Methodologies #Categorization #Comparison #Types
Grouping methodologies based on their core principles, approach to planning, and execution style.

### Predictive (Traditional/Waterfall) vs. Adaptive (Agile) #Spectrum #Dichotomy
The fundamental difference in handling requirements, scope, and change.

### Iterative and Incremental #DevelopmentCycles #Delivery
Approaches that involve cycles of development and delivering parts of the project over time. Often associated with Agile but can exist outside it.

### Flow-Based #ContinuousDelivery #Efficiency
Methodologies focusing on continuous workflow and limiting work in progress (e.g., Kanban).

### Hybrid Approaches #Blended #Integration
Combining elements from different methodologies to suit specific project needs.

### Process-Based vs. Lightweight #Complexity #Overhead
Comparing comprehensive, process-heavy approaches with simpler, less prescriptive ones.

## Traditional/Predictive Methodologies #Waterfall #Sequential #PlanningDriven
Characterized by detailed upfront planning, fixed scope, and sequential phases. Best suited for projects with stable requirements.

### Waterfall Model #Linear #Sequential #Phased
The classic sequential approach: Requirements -> Design -> Implementation -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintenance.
Emphasis on documentation and formal sign-offs between phases.

#### Phases of Waterfall #Stages #Process
Detailed breakdown of each typical phase.

#### Pros and Cons of Waterfall #Advantages #Disadvantages
Simplicity, clear structure vs. inflexibility, late feedback, difficulty managing change.

#### When to Use Waterfall #Applicability #Context
Projects with well-defined requirements, low uncertainty, and where detailed upfront planning is feasible.

### Critical Path Method (CPM) #Scheduling #NetworkDiagram #DurationFocused

#### Using CPM for Planning and Control #Application #Monitoring

### Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) #ResourceConstraints #Buffers #TheoryOfConstraints
Focuses on resource availability and managing project uncertainty using buffers (project buffer, feeding buffers, resource buffers) instead of padding individual task estimates. Developed by Eliyahu Goldratt.

#### Key Principles of CCPM #Concepts #Buffers
Resource leveling, buffer management, reducing multitasking.

#### Differences from CPM #Comparison #Focus
Emphasis on resources and buffers vs. task dependencies and duration.

## Agile Methodologies #Iterative #Adaptive #ValueDriven #Collaboration
