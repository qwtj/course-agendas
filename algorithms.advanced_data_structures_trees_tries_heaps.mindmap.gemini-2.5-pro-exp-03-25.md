## Foundational Concepts #Basics #Theory #Definitions
Core ideas underpinning trees, tries, and heaps.

### Hierarchical Structures #Hierarchy #Relationships
Data organized in parent-child relationships.

### Nodes and Edges #Components #GraphTheory
Basic building blocks: Nodes store data, Edges represent connections.

### Root, Parent, Child, Sibling, Leaf #TreeTerminology #Relationships
Defining roles and relationships within tree structures.
- Root: The topmost node.
- Parent: A node with descendants.
- Child: A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.
- Sibling: Nodes sharing the same parent.
- Leaf: A node with no children.

### Depth and Height #TreeMetrics #Measurement
Measuring levels and overall size.
- Depth: Length of the path from the root to a node.
- Height: Length of the longest path from a node to a leaf. Height of the tree is the height of the root.
