# Historical Inquisitions #Overview #ReligiousHistory #JudicialProcedure
The Inquisition was a group of institutions within the Catholic Church whose aim was to combat heresy, apostasy, witchcraft, and other perceived deviations from orthodox belief and practice. It operated as a judicial procedure where ecclesiastical judges could investigate and try cases within their jurisdiction. [1, 3]

## Origins and Context #Beginnings #Heresy #MedievalEurope
Context for the emergence of inquisitorial procedures and institutions.

### Pre-Inquisitorial Suppression of Heresy #EarlyChurch #CanonLaw
Before the 12th century, the Church primarily suppressed heresy through ecclesiastical proscription or imprisonment, generally without systematic torture or execution. [1] Some secular authorities did impose the death penalty for heresy. [1]

### Rise of Popular Heretical Movements #Catharism #Waldensianism #SocialChange
Significant popular movements considered heretical arose in the 12th century, notably the Cathars (Albigensians) in Southern France and the Waldensians in France and Northern Italy. [1, 8, 25] These movements challenged Church authority and doctrine.

### Initial Responses (Pre-1184) #LocalEfforts #EarlyPersecution
Early attempts to suppress heresy were often local and sometimes involved mob violence, though some clergy attempted to protect the accused. [25]

### Political and Social Factors #ChurchAuthority #SocialOrder #StatePower
Desire to maintain religious uniformity, consolidate Church authority, protect the social order, and sometimes align with secular rulers' interests contributed to the establishment of formal inquisitions. [25, 11]

## Episcopal Inquisition (c. 1184–1230s) #MedievalInquisition #Bishops #AdAbolendam
The earliest formal phase, administered by local bishops.

### Establishment by Papal Bull 'Ad abolendam' (1184) #PopeLuciusIII #Verona
Pope Lucius III issued the bull *Ad abolendam*, requiring bishops to make judicial inquiries (inquisitions) for heresy in their dioceses. [3, 8, 25] This marked the formal beginning of the Medieval Inquisition. [1, 25] Supported by Emperor Frederick I. [4]

### Role of Bishops #DiocesanAuthority #Investigation
Bishops were obligated to visit their dioceses searching for heretics and initiate investigations. [3, 25]

### Limitations and Effectiveness #Decentralization #Inconsistency
Episcopal inquisitions proved inconsistent and often ineffective due to the regional nature of bishops' power and varying implementation. [3]

## Papal Inquisition (Medieval) (c. 1230s onwards) #MedievalInquisition #Papacy #MendicantOrders
Centralization of inquisitorial authority under the Papacy.

### Establishment by Pope Gregory IX (c. 1231) #JudgesDelegate #Excommunicamus
Pope Gregory IX assigned the duty of carrying out inquisitions to specially appointed papal judges delegate, bypassing potentially ineffective local episcopal courts. [3, 7, 8, 25] The bull *Excommunicamus* (1231) formalized this permanent institution. [8]

### Role of Mendicant Orders #Dominicans #Franciscans
Inquisitors were frequently chosen from the recently founded Dominican and Franciscan orders, known for their theological training and independence from local politics. [1, 3, 7]

### Geographical Scope #France #Italy #HolyRomanEmpire
Primarily active in Southern France and Northern Italy, targeting Cathars and Waldensians, but also operated elsewhere. [1, 25] Later targeted groups like Spiritual Franciscans, Hussites, and Beguines. [1]

### Early Manuals #DirectoriumInquisitorum #BernardGui
Guidebooks like Bernard Gui's *Conduct of the Inquisition into Heretical Depravity* (early 14th C) and Nicolas Eymeric's *Directorium Inquisitorum* (1357) standardized procedures. [2, 7]

## Specific Regional and Later Inquisitions #EarlyModern #StateControl #GlobalReach
Distinct institutions operating from the 15th century onwards, often with strong state influence.

### Spanish Inquisition (1478–1834) #Spain #Conversos #Moriscos #StateControl
Established by Ferdinand II and Isabella I with papal authorization (Pope Sixtus IV) but under strong royal control. [3, 4, 21] Replaced the less active Medieval Inquisition in Spain. [4]
#### Origins #Reconquista #CatholicMonarchs #ReligiousUniformity
Created towards the end of the Reconquista to ensure Catholic orthodoxy, particularly among *Conversos* (Jewish converts) and later *Moriscos* (Muslim converts). [1, 4, 5, 21] Also seen as a tool to consolidate royal power. [4, 24]
#### Key Figures #TomasDeTorquemada #InquisitorGeneral
Tomás de Torquemada was the first and most infamous Inquisitor General, establishing tribunals across Spain. [2, 7, 21] Later Inquisitors General included Diego de Deza and Cardinal Cisneros. [2]
#### Targets #Conversos #Moriscos #Protestants #Erasmians #Mystics #Blasphemy #Bigamy #Sodomy
Initially focused intensely on *Conversos* suspected of crypto-Judaism. [4, 5, 21, 26] Later targeted *Moriscos*, Protestants (especially in the 1550s), Erasmians, *alumbrados* (Illuminists), those accused of blasphemy, bigamy, witchcraft (though relatively less intensely than secular courts), sodomy, and Freemasonry. [1, 2, 4, 10, 21] Did not typically prosecute unconverted Jews or Muslims, or Indigenous peoples in the Americas. [4, 10]
#### Expansion #SpanishEmpire #Americas #Colonies
Expanded to Spanish colonies in the Americas (e.g., Mexico, Peru established 1570), but Indigenous populations were generally excluded from its jurisdiction. [4, 7, 12, 21, 22]
#### Abolition #NapoleonicWars #Liberalism
Temporarily suppressed by Napoleon (1808), restored (1814), suppressed again (1820), restored (1823), and finally abolished permanently in 1834. [3, 7, 21, 22]

### Portuguese Inquisition (1536–1821) #Portugal #Conversos #Goa #Colonies
Established at the request of King João III, modeled after the Spanish Inquisition. [1, 3, 9, 14, 19]
#### Origins #JewishRefugees #RoyalRequest
Established partly due to the influx of Spanish *Conversos* fleeing the Spanish Inquisition. [1, 9, 14] Officially began in 1536. [1, 19]
#### Targets #NewChristians #Judaizers #Protestants #Hindus #Muslims #Bigamy #Witchcraft #Sodomy
Primarily targeted *Conversos* suspected of secretly practicing Judaism ("Judaizing"). [1, 5, 9, 14] Also prosecuted Protestants, Muslims, Hindus (in Goa), bigamy, witchcraft, sodomy, possession of forbidden books, and sacrilege. [9, 14, 19]
#### Expansion #PortugueseEmpire #Brazil #Goa #CapeVerde

#### Leadership #InquisitorGeneral #RoyalInfluence
Headed by a Grand Inquisitor, nominated by the Crown (often from the royal family) but appointed by the Pope. [1]
#### Pombal's Reforms #StateControl #Enlightenment

#### Scope and Function #CentralizedSupervision #Censorship #Doctrine
Acted as a central supervisory body for local Inquisitions, defending the faith, examining doctrine, and proscribing errors. [1, 3, 8] Responsible for the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (Index of Forbidden Books). [2, 7]
#### Famous Cases #GiordanoBruno #GalileoGalilei
Notable for the trials of figures like Giordano Bruno and Galileo Galilei (1633). [1, 2, 7]
#### Geography #Italy #PapalStates

#### Evolution #HolyOffice #CDF #DDF
Survived the abolition of other inquisitions in the 19th century. Renamed the Holy Office in 1908, reorganized as the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) by Pope Paul VI in 1965, and recently renamed the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith (DDF). [1, 3, 7]

## Organization and Structure #Tribunals #Officials #Bureaucracy
The administrative and personnel structure of inquisitorial bodies.

### Central Authority #Papacy #Crown #Suprema
Medieval Inquisitions answered primarily to the Pope. [3, 17] Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions were effectively departments of state under royal control, though nominally papal. [3, 4] Spain had the *Consejo de la Suprema y General Inquisición* ("Suprema") as a central council. [4, 17, 21] The Roman Inquisition was a central Papal congregation. [1, 3]

### Tribunals #LocalCourts #Jurisdiction
Regional courts responsible for investigations and trials in specific areas. [4, 17, 22] Spain had up to 21 tribunals across its empire. [4]

### Personnel #Inquisitors #Judges #Notaries #Officials
#### Inquisitors (Judges) #LegalTraining #Theology
Judges, often clergy (Dominicans, Franciscans in medieval times) with legal or theological training. [1, 3, 17, 24] Appointed by Pope or Crown depending on the Inquisition. [1, 3, 17]
#### Qualifiers (Calificadores) #TheologicalConsultants
Theological experts consulted to assess the heretical nature of beliefs or writings. [17]
#### Fiscal (Prosecutor) #Accusation
Responsible for formally presenting the case against the accused. [17]
#### Notaries #RecordKeeping
Recorded proceedings meticulously. [3, 17] Trial records provide much historical information. [1]
#### Constables (Alguaciles) #Arrest #LawEnforcement
Officials responsible for arresting suspects. [17, 21]
#### Familiars #LayAssistants #Informants #Privileges
Lay associates who assisted the Inquisition, often acting as informants, guards, or arresting officers. [17, 21] They enjoyed certain privileges (e.g., bearing arms, tax exemptions). [17, 21]
#### Jailers and Guards #Detention
Managed the prisons where suspects were held. [17, 24]

### Relationship with Secular Power #Cooperation #Execution
Inquisitions relied on secular authorities to arrest suspects and carry out physical punishments, especially executions ("relaxation to the secular arm"). [1, 3, 4, 8, 21] Cooperation was mandated. [8]

### Finances #Confiscation #StateFunding
Funded partly by the confiscation of property from convicted heretics. [1, 3, 16, 21] Secular rulers also contributed funds. [3] Debates exist on whether it operated as a "business". [16]

## Procedures and Methods #Investigation #Trial #Torture #Punishment
The process followed by inquisitorial tribunals.

### Initiation of Cases #Denunciation #Infamy #Investigation
Cases could begin through denunciation by informants, general public knowledge or rumour ("infamy"), or direct investigation by the inquisitor. [1] The *inquisitio* (inquiry) involved gathering information from anyone relevant. [1]

### Trial Process #Summons #Secrecy #LackOfCounsel
Accused were summoned before the tribunal. [1] Proceedings were often secret. [8] The accused was typically not told the names of accusers and often lacked legal counsel (lawyers feared being implicated). [2, 3] Defendant was informed of charges but often faced procedural disadvantages. [1, 2] The trial was often a "battle of wits" between inquisitor and accused. [3]

### Interrogation and Evidence #Confession #Witnesses
The primary goal was often to obtain a confession. [1, 6] Witness testimony was crucial, even if from anonymous sources. [3]

### Use of Torture #Coercion #Confession #Limits
Torture was authorized by Pope Innocent IV (1252) to elicit confessions from obstinate heretics. [3, 8] Its application varied; used systematically in the Spanish Inquisition but stated to be less frequent in later phases or other Inquisitions (e.g., Roman). [1, 2, 5, 8, 16] Methods included the rack (*potro*), waterboarding (*toca*), and strappado (*garrucha*). [6, 16] Ostensibly had limits (e.g., not to cause death or mutilation, generally applied only once), but these could be circumvented. [1, 6] Information gained under torture was considered potentially unreliable by inquisitors themselves, used mainly to extract verifiable facts or corroboration. [6] Some studies suggest torture was used in a minority of cases (e.g., 1-2% in Spanish Inquisition). [16]

### Judgments and Sentences #SermoGeneralis #AutoDaFe #Penance #Execution
Sentences were pronounced publicly at a ceremony called the *sermo generalis* or, most famously in Spain and Portugal, the *auto-da-fé* ("act of faith"). [1, 2, 3, 9, 21]
#### Penances #Prayer #Pilgrimage #Fines #Whipping #Sanbenito
Majority of sentences involved penances like prayers, fasting, pilgrimages, fines, public humiliation (wearing the *sanbenito*, a penitential garment), or whipping. [1, 2]
#### Confiscation of Property #FinancialPenalty
Assets of the convicted could be confiscated. [1, 3, 16]
#### Imprisonment #Incarceration
Varying terms of imprisonment were used. [1]
#### Relaxation to the Secular Arm #Execution #BurningAtStake
Unrepentant or relapsed heretics were handed over ("relaxed") to secular authorities for punishment according to local law, which usually meant execution, often by burning at the stake. [1, 2, 21] Estimates of executions vary, with modern estimates for the Spanish Inquisition suggesting 3,000-5,000 executions over three centuries (approx. 2.7% of prosecutions). [4]

## Targets of the Inquisition #Heresy #Minorities #SocialControl
Groups and behaviours investigated and prosecuted by the Inquisition.

### Heresy (Doctrinal Deviation) #CoreTarget #Orthodoxy
The primary justification and target – beliefs deviating from established Catholic doctrine. [1, 3, 21]
#### Specific Heretical Groups #Cathars #Waldensians #SpiritualFranciscans #Hussites #Protestants #Lutherans #Calvinists #Erasmians #Alumbrados
Targeted groups varied by time and place, including Cathars, Waldensians, Spiritual Franciscans, Hussites, Beguines, Protestants (Lutherans, Calvinists), Erasmians, and *Alumbrados*. [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 19, 21, 25]
#### Apostasy #RenunciationOfFaith
Abandonment of the Christian faith, often applied to converts suspected of returning to their former religion. [1]

### Religious Minorities (Converted) #Conversos #Moriscos #NewChristians
A major focus, particularly for the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions, was on converts suspected of insincere conversion or continued practice of their original faith (crypto-Judaism, crypto-Islam). [1, 4, 5, 9, 14, 21, 26]
#### Crypto-Judaism #Marranos #SecretJews
Jewish converts (*Conversos* or *New Christians*, sometimes pejoratively called *Marranos*) suspected of secretly practicing Judaism. [1, 4, 5, 9, 14]
#### Crypto-Islam #SecretMuslims
Muslim converts (*Moriscos*) suspected of secretly practicing Islam. [1, 4, 21]

### Witchcraft and Sorcery #Superstition #Magic
Prosecuted witchcraft, though often less intensely than secular courts, particularly in Spain where skepticism sometimes prevailed among inquisitors (e.g., Salazar de Frias). [1, 3, 4, 19, 21]

### Moral and Social Offenses #Blasphemy #Bigamy #Sodomy #Usury
Extended jurisdiction to offenses seen as violations of religious morality, such as blasphemy, bigamy, sodomy (homosexuality), and sometimes usury or forbidden books. [1, 4, 9, 11, 14, 21]

### Censorship #ForbiddenBooks #IndexLibrorumProhibitorum
Control over literature through the *Index Librorum Prohibitorum*, banning books deemed heretical or dangerous to faith and morals. [2, 7, 8]

## Decline and Abolition #Enlightenment #PoliticalChange #Secularization
Factors leading to the end of most inquisitorial bodies.

### Enlightenment Influence #Reason #Tolerance #HumanRights
Ideas of religious tolerance, reason, individual rights, and separation of church and state undermined the ideological basis of the Inquisition. [8]

### Political Upheaval #NapoleonicWars #LiberalRevolutions
The Napoleonic Wars led to the temporary or permanent abolition of inquisitions in occupied territories (e.g., Spain 1808). [1, 7] Subsequent liberal movements and revolutions in Spain, Portugal, and Italian states led to their final dissolution. [1, 3, 8, 9, 21]

### Formal Abolition Dates #Spain #Portugal #PapalStates
Portuguese Inquisition abolished 1821. [3, 9, 14, 19] Spanish Inquisition finally abolished 1834. [3, 7, 21, 22] Roman Inquisition transformed rather than abolished, continuing as the Holy Office/CDF/DDF. [1, 3, 7]

## Historiography and Legacy #HistoricalInterpretation #BlackLegend #ModernViews
How the Inquisition has been studied and remembered.

### Traditional Views vs. Modern Scholarship #MythVsReality #Quantification
Early accounts often emphasized brutality and vast numbers of victims. Modern scholarship, using archival records, has provided more nuanced views, quantifying actions and contextualizing the Inquisitions within their time, noting that many sentences were penances rather than execution. [1, 5, 16, 26]

### The "Black Legend" (Leyenda Negra) #AntiSpanishPropaganda #AntiCatholicism #Exaggeration
A term referring to the hypothesis that historical accounts, particularly of the Spanish Inquisition, were deliberately exaggerated and distorted by Spain's political and religious rivals (especially Protestant nations like England and the Netherlands) for propaganda purposes. [10, 12, 15, 16, 23] This propaganda depicted Spain and Catholicism as uniquely barbaric, intolerant, and cruel. [12, 15, 16, 23] Modern historians debate the extent and impact of this alleged propaganda. [10, 12]

### Cultural Impact #Fear #Intolerance #Censorship #Art #Literature
The Inquisition left a lasting legacy of fear, contributed to religious intolerance, enforced intellectual censorship, and has been depicted extensively in art and literature (e.g., Goya, Poe, Dostoevsky, Monty Python). [2, 7, 16, 21]

### Modern Successor: CDF/DDF #Vatican #Doctrine #Continuity
The Roman Inquisition's functions related to doctrinal oversight continue today through the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith (formerly CDF/Holy Office) within the Vatican Curia. [1, 3, 7]
