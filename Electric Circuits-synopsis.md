Learning Objectives: Understand basic circuit concepts, series/parallel circuits, circuit analysis techniques, behavior of capacitors/inductors, and AC circuit analysis.

Prerequisites: Basic algebra, introductory physics concepts (charge, energy).

Depth & Scope: Overview to intermediate; covers fundamental concepts and analysis techniques, omitting advanced topics like non-linear circuits or specialized components.

Target Audience: Students, hobbyists, or entry-level technicians.

Technical Details:
*   Ohm's Law (`V = IR`)
*   Power Dissipation (`P = IV = I^2R = V^2/R`)
*   Series/Parallel Resistance Formulas
*   KVL/KCL Equations
*   Thevenin/Norton Equivalent Circuits
*   Capacitor/Inductor Voltage-Current Relationships (`I = C * dV/dt`, `V = L * dI/dt`)
*   AC Power Formulas (`P = V_rms * I_rms * cos(Î¸)`)
*   Resistor color codes (example).

Relevant Technologies/Tools: Circuit simulators (e.g., LTspice, Multisim) are helpful.

Preferred Format/Length: Detailed explanations with concise examples for each concept.
