Emphasize their role as a secure bridge between the isolated renderer world and the privileged Node.js/Electron API world (via IPC or `contextBridge`). Ensure the next heading starts at level 4.</prompt>"

#### `contextBridge` Module
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 4, introducing `contextBridge` as the secure way to expose APIs from the preload script to the renderer process when `contextIsolation` is enabled (which it should be). Show the basic usage: `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('myAPI', { ... })` in preload, and `window.myAPI...` access in the renderer script. Emphasize that functions, not raw Node modules or data, should be exposed.
Example (preload.js):

```javascript
const { contextBridge, ipcRenderer } = require('electron');

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('electronAPI', {
  doSomething: () => ipcRenderer.send('do-something'),
  getFileData: async (filePath) => await ipcRenderer.invoke('get-file-data', filePath)
  // Do NOT expose ipcRenderer directly or Node modules like 'fs'
});
```

Example (renderer.js):

// No direct require('electron') here!
window.electronAPI.doSomething();
const data = await window.electronAPI.getFileData('/path/to/file');
console.log(data);

```

Ensure the next heading starts at level 4.</prompt>"
*   **Cross-reference:** This directly relates to IPC (Section V) and Security (Section VIII).

#### Node.js Access in Preload
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 4, clarifying that preload scripts *can* access Node.js APIs (like `require('fs')`) if `nodeIntegration` is false but the process isn't sandboxed. However, reiterate the best practice is *not* to expose these Node APIs directly to the renderer, but rather to wrap required functionality and expose it selectively and securely via `contextBridge` and IPC. Ensure the next heading starts at level 3.</prompt>"

### Web APIs in Renderer
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, reminding the learner that the Renderer process is essentially a Chromium browser environment. Therefore, standard browser Web APIs like `fetch` (for HTTP requests), `WebSocket`, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `IndexedDB`, `Web Workers`, `Canvas`, `WebGL`, etc., are available for use directly in the renderer's JavaScript. Ensure the next heading starts at level 3.</prompt>"

Explain why IPC is necessary due to process isolation, introduce the core `ipcMain` and `ipcRenderer` modules, differentiate between asynchronous and synchronous messaging patterns, discuss data sharing strategies, and outline best practices. Include learning objectives. Ensure the next heading starts at level 3.</prompt>"

*   **Learning Objectives:**
    *   Explain the need for IPC in Electron's multi-process architecture.
    *   Identify the roles of `ipcMain` (Main process) and `ipcRenderer` (Renderer process/Preload script).
    *   Implement asynchronous one-way messaging (`send`/`on`).
    *   Implement asynchronous two-way (request/response) messaging (`invoke`/`handle`).
    *   Understand the use and drawbacks of synchronous messaging (`sendSync`).
    *   Recognize data serialization requirements for IPC.
    *   Apply best practices for secure and efficient IPC using `contextBridge`.

### Why IPC?
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, explaining the fundamental reason for IPC: the strict separation between the Main process (Node.js/OS access) and Renderer processes (sandboxed web environment). State that IPC provides the channels for these isolated processes to communicate and coordinate tasks. Ensure the next heading starts at level 3.</prompt>"

### `ipcMain` and `ipcRenderer` Modules
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, introducing the core modules for IPC:
    *   `ipcMain`: Used in the Main process to listen for and respond to messages from Renderer processes (`ipcMain.on`, `ipcMain.handle`).
    *   `ipcRenderer`: Used in Preload scripts (ideally, not directly in Renderer) to send messages to the Main process (`ipcRenderer.send`, `ipcRenderer.invoke`) and listen for messages from the Main process (`ipcRenderer.on`).
Emphasize that direct use of `ipcRenderer` in the Renderer process itself is discouraged when `contextIsolation` is enabled. Ensure the next heading starts at level 3.</prompt>"
*   **Callout:** Highlight the security implications of exposing `ipcRenderer` directly vs. wrapping it via `contextBridge`.

### Asynchronous Messaging (`invoke`/`handle`, `send`/`on`)
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, explaining the preferred asynchronous methods for IPC, which prevent blocking processes. Ensure the next heading starts at level 4.</prompt>"

#### Main -> Renderer (`webContents.send`)
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 4, demonstrating one-way asynchronous communication from the Main process to a specific Renderer process using `window.webContents.send('channel', ...args)`. Show how the Preload script can listen using `ipcRenderer.on('channel', (event, ...args) => { ... })` and potentially forward the data safely to the Renderer via `contextBridge`.
Example (main.js):

```javascript
myWindow.webContents.send('update-counter', 1);
```

Example (preload.js):

```javascript
const { ipcRenderer, contextBridge } = require('electron');

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('electronAPI', {
  onUpdateCounter: (callback) => ipcRenderer.on('update-counter', (_event, value) => callback(value))
});
```

Example (renderer.js):

```javascript
window.electronAPI.onUpdateCounter((value) => {
  console.log('Counter updated:', value);
});
```

Ensure the next heading starts at level 4.</prompt>"

#### Renderer -> Main (`ipcRenderer.send`, `ipcRenderer.invoke`)
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 4, showing one-way (`send`) and two-way (`invoke`) asynchronous communication from the Renderer (via Preload) to the Main process.
*   One-way (`send`/`on`): Use `ipcRenderer.send('channel', ...args)` in Preload, and `ipcMain.on('channel', (event, ...args) => { ... })` in Main.
*   Two-way (`invoke`/`handle`): Use `await ipcRenderer.invoke('channel', ...args)` in Preload, and `ipcMain.handle('channel', async (event, ...args) => { /* process request */; return result; })` in Main. Emphasize `invoke`/`handle` for request/response patterns.
Example (preload.js):

```javascript
// (Assuming contextBridge exposes these methods)
async function getUserData(userId) {
  return await ipcRenderer.invoke('get-user-data', userId);
}
function notifyMain(message) {
  ipcRenderer.send('notification', message);
}
```

Example (main.js):

```javascript
const { ipcMain } = require('electron');

ipcMain.handle('get-user-data', async (event, userId) => {
  // const user = await database.findUser(userId); // Example async operation
  return { id: userId, name: 'Example User' }; // Must return a serializable result or Promise
});

ipcMain.on('notification', (event, message) => {
  console.log('Notification from renderer:', message);
  // event.sender refers to the webContents that sent the message
});
```

Ensure the next heading starts at level 4.</prompt>"

#### Main <-> Renderer (Request/Response with `invoke`/`handle`)
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 4, specifically highlighting the `invoke`/`handle` pattern as the modern, recommended approach for two-way, asynchronous request/response communication between Renderer (via Preload) and Main. Reiterate the example from the previous section, emphasizing the use of `async`/`await` for handling the Promises involved. Ensure the next heading starts at level 3.</prompt>"

### Synchronous Messaging (`ipcRenderer.sendSync`)
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, explaining `ipcRenderer.sendSync('channel', ...args)` which allows a Renderer (via Preload) to send a message and synchronously block execution until the Main process returns a value using `event.returnValue = ...` in the `ipcMain.on` handler. Strongly advise against its use due to performance implications (blocking the Renderer). Mention potential limited use cases (e.g., during initial setup) but emphasize that asynchronous alternatives are almost always better. Ensure the next heading starts at level 3.</prompt>"
*   **Callout:** **Use `sendSync` with extreme caution!** It can easily lead to an unresponsive UI.

### Sharing Data Between Processes
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, explaining that any data passed between processes via IPC must be serializable. Mention that standard JavaScript primitives (strings, numbers, booleans), arrays, and plain objects are generally fine as they can be JSON-serialized. Note limitations for complex objects like class instances (methods are lost), Dates (often converted to strings), Buffers, etc., and that specific handling might be required. Ensure the next heading starts at level 3.</prompt>"

### Best Practices for IPC
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, summarizing best practices for IPC:
    *   **Security:** Always use `contextIsolation: true`. Expose IPC functionality from Preload to Renderer *only* via `contextBridge`. Never expose `ipcRenderer` or Node modules directly.
    *   **Validation:** Treat all data received via IPC in the Main process as untrusted. Validate arguments and sanitize inputs.
    *   **Asynchronicity:** Strongly prefer asynchronous patterns (`invoke`/`handle`, `send`/`on`) over synchronous (`sendSync`).
    *   **Specificity:** Define clear channel names and minimize the surface area of exposed IPC functions.
    *   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for `invoke`/`handle` calls (e.g., using try/catch in Preload/Renderer, handling errors in Main).
Ensure the next heading starts at level 3.</prompt>"
*   **Cross-reference:** Security is paramount, see Section VIII. Performance impacts discussed in Section IX.

### Accessing Native OS Features
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, emphasizing that Electron's main advantage is bridging web technologies with native OS capabilities, primarily accessed via the Main process or securely requested via IPC. Ensure the next heading starts at level 3.</prompt>"

### File System Access
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, detailing file system interaction. Explain that direct file system access should happen in the Main process using Node's built-in `fs` and `path` modules. Show how user interaction (like choosing a file) is typically initiated using the `dialog` module, and the resulting path is then used by `fs` methods in the Main process. Provide a combined example involving `dialog.showOpenDialog` and `fs.readFile`.
Example (main.js - often within an `ipcMain.handle`):

```javascript
const { dialog, ipcMain } = require('electron');
const fs = require('fs').promises; // Use promise-based fs

ipcMain.handle('read-file', async () => {
  const { canceled, filePaths } = await dialog.showOpenDialog({ properties: ['openFile'] });
  if (canceled || filePaths.length === 0) {
    return { error: 'No file selected' };
  }
  try {
    const content = await fs.readFile(filePaths[0], 'utf-8');
    return { data: content };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to read file:', error);
    return { error: `Failed to read file: ${error.message}` };
  }
});
```

*   **Cross-reference:** `dialog` module introduced in Section III, IPC in Section V.

### Desktop Notifications (`Notification` module)
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, introducing the `Notification` API for displaying native OS notifications. Show how to check for support (`Notification.isSupported()`) and create a basic notification with a title and body. Mention that notifications can be created from either the Main or Renderer process (if enabled), but often make sense triggered from Main based on backend events.
Example (main or renderer with nodeIntegration/contextBridge):

```javascript
const { Notification } = require('electron');

function showNotification() {
  if (Notification.isSupported()) {
    const notification = new Notification({
      title: 'Hello!',
      body: 'This is a native notification.'
      // icon: path.join(__dirname, 'icon.png') // optional
    });
    notification.show();

  } else {
    console.log('Notifications not supported on this system.');
  }
}
```

Mention it's typically used in the Main process or exposed securely via IPC.
Example (main.js or preload.js):

```javascript
const { clipboard } = require('electron');

function copyText() {
  clipboard.writeText('Text to be copied!');
  console.log('Text copied to clipboard.');
}

Show how to get all displays (`screen.getAllDisplays()`), the primary display (`screen.getPrimaryDisplay()`), and the cursor's current position (`screen.getCursorScreenPoint()`). Mention use cases like positioning windows intelligently or multi-monitor support.
Example (main.js):

```javascript
const { screen } = require('electron');

app.whenReady().then(() => {
  const primaryDisplay = screen.getPrimaryDisplay();
  const { width, height } = primaryDisplay.workAreaSize;
  console.log(`Primary display work area: ${width}x${height}`);

  const currentCursorPos = screen.getCursorScreenPoint();
  console.log(`Cursor position: ${currentCursorPos.x}, ${currentCursorPos.y}`);

  const allDisplays = screen.getAllDisplays();
  console.log(`Detected ${allDisplays.length} displays.`);
});
```

Ensure the next heading starts at level 3.</prompt>"

### Protocol Handling (`protocol` module)
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, explaining the `protocol` module's function for registering custom URL protocols (e.g., `myapp://resource`) or intercepting existing ones (like `file://` or `http://`). Show a basic example of registering a custom protocol to serve local files using `protocol.registerFileProtocol`. Mention its use for custom resource loading schemes.
Example (main.js):

```javascript
const { app, protocol } = require('electron');
const path = require('path');

app.whenReady().then(() => {
  protocol.registerFileProtocol('myapp', (request, callback) => {
    const url = request.url.substr(8); // Remove 'myapp://'
    const filePath = path.normalize(path.join(__dirname, 'app-data', url));
    console.log(`Serving file: ${filePath}`);
    callback({ path: filePath });
  });

  // Now you can load 'myapp://some/file.html' in a BrowserWindow
});
```

Ensure the next heading starts at level 2.</prompt>"

## Section Transition
"<prompt>Generate a brief transition statement, emphasizing that while packaging makes the app available, ensuring it's secure is paramount. The next section delves into critical security considerations for Electron development. Ensure the next heading starts at level 2.</prompt>"

# VIII. Security Considerations

## Building Secure Desktop Applications
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 2, focusing on security best practices and potential vulnerabilities in Electron applications. Cover the Electron security model, context isolation, disabling Node integration in renderers, webview security, sandboxing, Content Security Policy (CSP), validating IPC messages, secure remote content loading, dependency auditing, and the official security checklist. Include learning objectives. Ensure the next heading starts at level 3.</prompt>"

*   **Learning Objectives:**
    *   Understand the core security principle of process isolation in Electron.
    *   Recognize the importance of `contextIsolation` and `nodeIntegration: false`.
    *   Securely expose APIs using `contextBridge` instead of direct Node access in renderers.
    *   Understand the risks associated with the `<webview>` tag and prefer alternatives.
    *   Implement sandboxing for renderer processes where applicable.
    *   Apply Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.
    *   Validate all data received via IPC in the Main process.
    *   Audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Consult and follow the official Electron security checklist.

### Electron Security Model
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, outlining Electron's security model based on process isolation (Main vs. Renderer) inherited from Chromium. Explain that the primary threat vector is often malicious code execution within a Renderer process, potentially gaining access to Node.js APIs and the underlying OS if security measures are bypassed. Emphasize that security is a developer responsibility. Ensure the next heading starts at level 3.</prompt>"
*   **Callout:** Security in Electron is not automatic; it requires conscious effort and adherence to best practices.

### Context Isolation
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, explaining `contextIsolation` as a critical security feature (enabled by default in recent Electron versions). Ensure the next heading starts at level 4.</prompt>"
*   **Cross-reference:** Introduced in Section III (BrowserWindow) and Section IV (Preload Scripts).

#### Enabling Context Isolation
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 4, stating that `contextIsolation: true` (the default) should always be used in the `webPreferences` when creating a `BrowserWindow`. Explain that it ensures the preload script and the renderer's main world JavaScript run in separate contexts, preventing the renderer from directly accessing Electron internals or the preload script's higher privileges. Ensure the next heading starts at level 4.</prompt>"

#### Impact on Preload Scripts
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 4, reiterating that with `contextIsolation: true`, the only way to expose functionality from the preload script to the renderer is via `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld()`.

    *   Utilize Web Workers, `UtilityProcess`, or Node.js `worker_threads` / `child_process` to offload heavy tasks.
    *   Understand the performance characteristics of `BrowserView`.

### Identifying Bottlenecks
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, explaining the first step in optimization: identifying performance issues. Recommend using the Performance and Memory tabs in Chrome DevTools for profiling the Renderer process (CPU usage, rendering bottlenecks, event handling times, memory allocation). Mention using Node.js profiling tools (`--prof`) or the DevTools Node inspector (`--inspect`) for the Main process. Ensure the next heading starts at level 3.</prompt>"
*   **Further Reading:** [Chrome DevTools Performance Analysis Reference](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance/), [Node.js Diagnostics - Profiling](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/diagnostics/profiling)

### Startup Performance
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, focusing on minimizing the time from launching the app to it becoming interactive ('Time to Interactive'). Suggest strategies:
    *   **Lazy Loading/Requiring:** Delay loading modules or components until they are actually needed, especially in the Main process. Use `require()` inside functions instead of at the top level for less critical modules.
    *   **Code Splitting:** Use bundlers like Webpack or Parcel to split Renderer JavaScript code into smaller chunks loaded on demand.
    *   **ASAR Archives:** Using ASAR (usually default with build tools) can slightly improve `require` times compared to loose files.
    *   **Minimize Main Process Work:** Do only essential setup in the Main process before creating the first window.
Ensure the next heading starts at level 3.</prompt>"

### Runtime Performance
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, addressing performance during application use. Suggest techniques:
    *   **Efficient IPC:** Prefer asynchronous IPC. Avoid `sendSync`. Batch multiple small IPC messages if appropriate. Ensure IPC handlers in the Main process are fast and non-blocking.
    *   **DOM Manipulation:** Minimize large or frequent DOM updates in the Renderer. Use efficient rendering strategies (virtual DOM with frameworks, `requestAnimationFrame`).
    *   **Throttling/Debouncing:** Limit the rate of execution for event handlers that fire frequently (e.g., `resize`, `scroll`, user input) using throttling or debouncing techniques.
    *   **UI Responsiveness:** Keep the UI thread (Renderer) free from long-running synchronous tasks.
Ensure the next heading starts at level 3.</prompt>"

### Memory Management
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, discussing memory usage. Explain the importance of avoiding memory leaks (objects that are no longer needed but not garbage collected).
    *   **Leak Detection:** Use the Memory tab in Chrome DevTools to take heap snapshots and compare them to identify detached DOM elements or growing object counts.
    *   **Garbage Collection:** Understand that JavaScript relies on automatic garbage collection, but leaks can still occur (e.g., uncleared event listeners, closures holding references). Explicitly nullify references when objects are no longer needed.
    *   **Profiling:** Analyze memory allocation timelines to pinpoint code sections causing excessive memory churn.
Ensure the next heading starts at level 3.</prompt>"

const { _electron: electron } = require('playwright');
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('should launch and display initial text', async () => {
  const electronApp = await electron.launch({ args: ['.'] }); // Launch app in dev mode
  const window = await electronApp.firstWindow();

  await expect(window.locator('h1')).toHaveText('Hello World!'); // Check heading text

      dialog: { showOpenDialog: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ canceled: false, filePaths: ['/mock/file.txt'] }) },
      ipcRenderer: { invoke: jest.fn() }
    }));

    const myModule = require('./my-module'); // Module that uses mocked electron APIs

      expect(myModule.getConfigPath()).toBe('/mock/path/config.json');
    });
    ```


### Testing IPC Communication
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, discussing strategies for testing IPC:
    *   **Unit Testing:** Mock `ipcRenderer` (in Preload tests) and `ipcMain` (in Main process tests) to verify that messages are sent (`invoke`/`send` called with correct args) and handlers (`handle`/`on`) behave correctly when simulated messages are received.
    *   **E2E Testing:** Verify the *effects* of IPC calls. For example, trigger an action in the UI (Renderer) that sends an IPC message, and assert that the expected change occurs (either in the UI after a response, or by checking side effects controlled by the Main process, like file creation if possible).
Ensure the next heading starts at level 3.</prompt>"

### Continuous Integration (CI)
"<prompt>Generate a section starting with heading level 3, explaining the importance of integrating automated tests (Unit and E2E) into a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using services like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, GitLab CI, or CircleCI.
