    * Ninja.

## Exploring Common Build System Features

### Dependency Management
    * Declaring dependencies.
    * Resolving transitive dependencies.
    * Version control of dependencies.

### Compilation and Linking
    * Handling compiler flags (e.g., `-Wall`, `-O2`).
    * Creating object files (`.o`).
    * Linking object files and libraries into executables.

### Testing and Quality Assurance
    * Integrating unit tests.
    * Running static analysis tools.
    * Generating code coverage reports.

    * Creating archives (e.g., `.tar.gz`, `.zip`).
    * Generating installers.
    * Deploying software.

# II. Make: A Foundational Build System

## Learning Make Syntax and Semantics

### Understanding Makefiles
    * Structure of a Makefile (targets, dependencies, recipes).
    * Defining variables.
    * Using built-in functions (e.g., `$(wildcard *.c)`).

### Writing Basic Rules
    * Target: Dependencies.
    * Recipe (commands to execute).
    * Example:
      ```makefile
      myprogram: main.o utils.o
          gcc -o myprogram main.o utils.o

      main.o: main.c
          gcc -c main.c

      utils.o: utils.c
          gcc -c utils.c
      ```

### Using Pattern Rules

    * Applying generalized rules.
    * Example:
      ```makefile
      %.o: %.c
          gcc -c $< -o $@
      ```

### Understanding Automatic Variables

    * `$@` (target file).
    * `$<` (first dependency).
    * `$^` (all dependencies).

## Implementing Dependency Tracking

### Utilizing Make's Dependency Graph
    * How Make determines what needs to be rebuilt.
    * Implicit rules and dependency inference.

### Handling Header File Dependencies
    * Using `-MMD` flag in GCC to generate dependency files.
    * Including dependency files in the Makefile.

### Debugging Makefiles

    * Using `-n` (dry run) option.
    * Using `-d` (debug) option.
    * Examining error messages.

## Practical Make Project

### Creating a Simple C Project with Make

    * Structure the project with source files and header files.
    * Write a Makefile to compile and link the project.
    * Add rules for cleaning up build artifacts.

### Adding Unit Tests

    * Integrate a simple unit testing framework (e.g., using `assert.h`).
    * Create a target to run the unit tests.

### Packaging the Project

    * Create a target to generate a `.tar.gz` archive.
    * Include necessary files in the archive.

# III. CMake: A Cross-Platform Build System

## Understanding CMake Fundamentals

### CMakeLists.txt Structure
    * Basic commands: `cmake_minimum_required`, `project`, `add_executable`, `add_library`.
    * Setting variables: `set`, `${}`.

### Configuring and Building with CMake

    * Creating a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`.
    * Running CMake: `cmake ..`.
    * Building the project: `make`.

### Target Management

    * Executables: `add_executable`.
    * Static libraries: `add_library (STATIC)`.
    * Shared libraries: `add_library (SHARED)`.

## Managing Dependencies in CMake

### Finding External Libraries
    * Using `find_package`.
    * Specifying required components.
    * Handling missing dependencies.

### Linking Libraries
    * Using `target_link_libraries`.
    * Public vs. Private vs. Interface linking.

### Installing Targets

    * Using `install`.
    * Specifying install locations: `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.

## Advanced CMake Features

### Using Modules

    * Creating custom CMake modules.
    * Reusing common build logic.

### Generating Configuration Files

    * Using `configure_file`.
    * Passing variables from CMake to configuration files.

### Cross-Compilation

    * Setting up toolchains.
    * Using CMake toolchain files.

## Practical CMake Project

### Converting a Make Project to CMake

    * Migrate an existing Make-based project to use CMake.
    * Ensure cross-platform compatibility.

### Adding Unit Tests with CTest

    * Integrate CTest for running unit tests.
    * Add tests using `add_test`.

### Packaging with CPack

    * Generate installers using CPack.
    * Support different packaging formats (e.g., `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.msi`).

# IV. Modern Build System Concepts

## Understanding Build System Design Principles

### Incremental Builds
    * Minimizing rebuild time.
    * Utilizing dependency tracking.

### Parallel Builds
    * Leveraging multi-core processors.
    * Specifying number of jobs.

### Reproducible Builds
    * Ensuring consistent build results across different environments.
    * Using dependency locking.

## Exploring Advanced Build Tools

### Bazel: Scalable and Hermetic Builds
