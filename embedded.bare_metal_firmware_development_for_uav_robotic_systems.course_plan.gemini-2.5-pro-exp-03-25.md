*   *Difficulty Level:* Intermediate to Advanced

## Control Theory Fundamentals
"<prompt>Introduce basic concepts of control systems theory as applied to UAVs, explaining the goal of maintaining stability and tracking desired setpoints (e.g., attitude, altitude, position)."

### Open-loop vs. Closed-loop Control
"<prompt>Explain the difference between open-loop control (no feedback, e.g., setting motor speeds directly) and closed-loop control (using sensor feedback to adjust outputs). Emphasize why closed-loop control is essential for UAV stability."

### PID Controllers (Proportional, Integral, Derivative)
"<prompt>Introduce the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller as the most common algorithm for closed-loop control in UAVs. Explain the purpose of each term: Proportional (reacts to current error), Integral (eliminates steady-state error), and Derivative (dampens oscillations, reacts to rate of change of error)."
*   `<prompt>`: "Describe the role of each PID term (P, I, D) in the context of stabilizing a UAV's pitch or roll angle. Explain how increasing each gain (Kp, Ki, Kd) typically affects the system's response: P affects speed of response and oscillation, I affects steady-state error removal but can cause overshoot, D affects damping and stability."

Show inputs (target angle, current angle from AHRS), error calculation, PID computation (`output = Kp*error + Ki*integral_error + Kd*derivative_error`), integral windup prevention (clamping the integral term), and output clamping."

### Altitude Control
"<prompt>Describe how a PID controller can be used to maintain a desired altitude, using barometer or rangefinder data as feedback. Explain how the PID output typically adjusts the overall thrust level."

### Position Control (Requires GPS/Localization)
"<prompt>Explain that position control (holding a GPS coordinate or following waypoints) typically involves cascaded PID loops. Outer loops calculate desired lean angles (roll/pitch) based on position error, and these desired angles become the setpoints for the inner attitude control loops."

    *   `uORB`: The publish-subscribe messaging API used internally within the PX4 flight stack.
*   *Quiz:*
    "<prompt>Generate 3 questions: 1. What is the main difference between HIL and SIL simulation? 2. Why is gradual flight testing (e.g., starting with tethered tests) recommended? 3. Name one key architectural feature of the PX4 flight stack."
*   *Reflective Prompt:*
    "<prompt>Prompt the learner to reflect: What are the primary advantages and disadvantages of developing completely custom UAV firmware from scratch versus choosing to adapt or contribute to an existing open-source flight stack like PX4 or ArduPilot for a specific project?"
*   *Further Reading:*
    *   "<prompt>Provide placeholder links to the official documentation websites for PX4 and ArduPilot." -> `[Placeholder: Link to PX4 Documentation], [Placeholder: Link to ArduPilot Documentation]`
    *   "<prompt>Provide a placeholder link to resources on setting up HIL simulation with Gazebo or jMAVSim." -> `[Placeholder: Link to HIL Simulation Setup Guide]`
*   *Callout:* **Safety First!** Real-world flight testing carries inherent risks. Always prioritize safety, follow local regulations, choose safe flying locations, and proceed cautiously. Never fly experimental firmware near people or property.
