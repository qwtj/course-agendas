Learning Objectives: Understand OS kernel fundamentals, boot process, memory management, interrupts, processes, synchronization, file systems, and debugging.

Prerequisites: C/C++ programming, basic computer architecture, assembly language fundamentals, and familiarity with command-line tools.

Depth & Scope: Overview to Intermediate; Focus on fundamental concepts and practical implementation of a basic kernel.

Target Audience: Developers, students, or enthusiasts with interest in operating systems.

Technical Details: Example code snippets for memory allocators (buddy system, slab allocator), interrupt handlers (IDT setup), device drivers (UART interaction), process scheduling (round robin, priority-based), synchronization (mutexes, semaphores), and file system implementation (inode structure, file creation).  Reference to x86_64 or ARM assembly language.

Relevant Technologies/Tools: C, Assembly (x86_64 or ARM), GCC, GDB, Make, QEMU, VirtualBox, Linux.

Preferred Format/Length: Detailed explanations with concise examples; Provide working examples of concepts such as memory allocation, interrupt handling, basic device driver interaction, and synchronization primitives.
