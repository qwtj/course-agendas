The combined fields focused on creating effective, efficient, and enjoyable interactions between users and digital products or services.

## Foundational Concepts #Basics #Theory #Definitions
Core ideas underpinning UI/UX design.

### Defining UI (User Interface) #UI #Interface #Visuals
Focuses on the visual elements and interactive properties of a product; how it looks and how users interact with its surface.
* Graphical elements (buttons, icons, typography, color, layout)
* Interaction points

### Defining UX (User Experience) #UX #Experience #UserFocus
Focuses on the overall feeling and satisfaction a user has when interacting with a product; encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction.
* Usability, accessibility, desirability, credibility, findability, usefulness, value
