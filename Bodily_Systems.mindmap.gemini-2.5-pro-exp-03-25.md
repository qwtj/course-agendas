##### Blood Vessel Diameter #Level4 #MostImportantFactor #InverselyRelatedToResistance #Arterioles #VasomotorControl
Most significant factor influencing resistance. Resistance varies inversely with the fourth power of the vessel radius (R ∝ 1/r^4). Small changes in diameter dramatically affect resistance. Arterioles are the major determinants of peripheral resistance due to their ability to change diameter frequently (vasoconstriction/vasodilation).
#### Regulation of Blood Pressure and Flow #Level3 #Homeostasis #Neural #Hormonal #Autoregulation
Maintaining adequate blood pressure and flow is crucial for tissue perfusion. Regulation involves short-term neural and hormonal controls, and long-term renal mechanisms. Autoregulation adjusts local blood flow.

##### Short-Term Regulation: Hormonal Controls #Level4 #SlowerResponse #AdrenalMedulla #AngiotensinII #ADH #ANP
Hormones influence BP in the short term via changes in peripheral resistance or in the long term via changes in blood volume. Examples: Adrenal medulla hormones (Epi/NE increase BP), Angiotensin II (vasoconstrictor, increases BP), ADH (vasoconstriction, increases BP via water retention), Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP, decreases BP by causing vasodilation and salt/water loss).
##### Long-Term Regulation: Renal Mechanisms #Level4 #SlowestResponse #BloodVolumeControl #Kidneys #RAAS
Kidneys regulate BP long-term by altering blood volume via direct (altering filtration rate) and indirect (Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System - RAAS) mechanisms. RAAS leads to aldosterone and ADH release, causing salt/water retention and increased BP.
##### Autoregulation (Local Control) #Level4 #IntrinsicControl #TissueNeeds #Metabolic #Myogenic
Automatic adjustment of blood flow to each tissue in proportion to its requirements at any given point in time. Independent of systemic factors. Two types: Metabolic controls (changes in chemical environment, e.g., O2, CO2, H+, cause vasodilation) and Myogenic controls (vascular smooth muscle responds directly to stretch, causing vasoconstriction if stretched, vasodilation if not).

#### Pressure Relationships #Level3 #Atmospheric #Intrapulmonary #Intrapleural
Pressures involved in ventilation.
##### Atmospheric Pressure (Patm) #Level4 #ExternalAirPressure #~760mmHg_at_SeaLevel
Pressure exerted by the air surrounding the body. Considered 0 for relative measurements.
##### Intrapulmonary (Intra-alveolar) Pressure (Ppul) #Level4 #PressureInAlveoli #Fluctuates #EqualizesWithPatm
Pressure within the alveoli. Fluctuates with breathing phases but always eventually equalizes with atmospheric pressure.
##### Intrapleural Pressure (Pip) #Level4 #PressureInPleuralCavity #AlwaysNegative #~-4mmHg #KeepsLungsInflated
Pressure within the pleural cavity. Always negative relative to intrapulmonary pressure (~4 mm Hg less than Ppul). Caused by opposing forces (lungs recoil inward, chest wall pulls outward). Negative Pip acts like suction to keep lungs inflated and clinging to thoracic wall. If Pip = Ppul or Patm, lung collapses (pneumothorax).
#### Inspiration (Inhalation) #Level3 #ActiveProcess #MusclesContract #VolumeIncreases #PressureDecreases #AirIn
Air flows into the lungs. Active process involving muscle contraction.
##### Diaphragm Contracts #Level4 #MovesInferiorly #IncreasesThoracicVolume_Vertical

##### Volume Increase -> Pressure Decrease #Level4 #Ppul_DropsBelowPatm #AirFlowsIn
Increased thoracic volume -> Increased intrapleural volume -> Decreased Pip. Lungs stretch -> Increased intrapulmonary volume -> Decreased Ppul (by ~1 mm Hg below Patm). Air flows into lungs down pressure gradient until Ppul = Patm.
##### Forced Inspiration #Level4 #AccessoryMuscles #GreaterVolumeIncrease

#### Basic Gas Laws #Level3 #Daltons #Henrys
Principles governing gas behavior.
##### Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures #Level4 #TotalPressure #SumOfPartials
The total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is the sum of the pressures exerted independently by each gas in the mixture. The pressure exerted by each gas (its partial pressure) is directly proportional to its percentage in the mixture.
##### Henry's Law #Level4 #GasDissolvingInLiquid #PartialPressure #Solubility
When a gas is in contact with a liquid, the gas will dissolve in the liquid in proportion to its partial pressure. The amount dissolved also depends on the gas's solubility in the liquid and the temperature. (CO2 is much more soluble than O2).
#### External Respiration #Level3 #Lungs #AlveoliBlood #O2Loading #CO2Unloading
Gas exchange between the alveoli and the pulmonary capillary blood. O2 moves from alveoli (high PO2) into blood (low PO2). CO2 moves from blood (high PCO2) into alveoli (low PCO2). Equilibrium is reached quickly (~0.25 sec). Influenced by partial pressure gradients, gas solubilities, respiratory membrane thickness/surface area, ventilation-perfusion coupling.
##### Ventilation-Perfusion Coupling #Level4 #MatchingAirflowBloodflow #Efficiency
Mechanisms matching alveolar ventilation (airflow) with pulmonary blood flow (perfusion) for efficient gas exchange. High alveolar O2 causes arterioles to dilate; low O2 causes constriction. High alveolar CO2 causes bronchioles to dilate; low CO2 causes constriction.
#### Internal Respiration #Level3 #Tissues #BloodSystemicCapillaries #O2Unloading #CO2Loading
Gas exchange between the systemic capillary blood and the tissue cells. O2 moves from blood (high PO2) into tissues (low PO2). CO2 moves from tissues (high PCO2) into blood (low PCO2). Driven by partial pressure gradients created by cellular respiration in tissues.

#### Oxygen Transport #Level3 #HemoglobinBinding #DissolvedInPlasma
Oxygen is transported mainly bound to hemoglobin within RBCs, with a small amount dissolved in plasma.
##### Bound to Hemoglobin (Hb) #Level4 #~98.5%OfO2 #Oxyhemoglobin #ReversibleBinding
Most O2 (~98.5%) binds reversibly to the iron atoms in the heme groups of hemoglobin, forming oxyhemoglobin (HbO2). Each Hb molecule can bind up to 4 O2 molecules. Binding/release depends primarily on PO2 (Oxygen-Hemoglobin Dissociation Curve).
###### Oxygen-Hemoglobin Dissociation Curve #Level5 #SigmoidShape #CooperativeBinding #LoadingUnloading #FactorsAffectingAffinity
S-shaped curve showing the relationship between Hb saturation and blood PO2. Cooperative binding (binding of one O2 increases affinity for next). Steep slope in tissue PO2 range facilitates O2 unloading. Plateau in lung PO2 range ensures full loading. Affinity of Hb for O2 is decreased (curve shifts right, more O2 unloaded) by increased temperature, increased PCO2, increased H+ (decreased pH) - Bohr effect, and increased BPG (metabolite from RBC glycolysis).
##### Dissolved in Plasma #Level4 #~1.5%OfO2 #PoorlySoluble
Only about 1.5% of O2 is transported dissolved in plasma because O2 is poorly soluble in water.
#### Carbon Dioxide Transport #Level3 #MultipleForms #Dissolved #BoundToHb #BicarbonateIons
CO2 is transported in blood in three forms.
##### Dissolved in Plasma #Level4 #~7-10% #MoreSolubleThanO2
Smallest amount (~7-10%) is transported dissolved in plasma. CO2 is more soluble than O2.
##### Bound to Hemoglobin #Level4 #~20% #Carbaminohemoglobin #BindsToGlobin
About 20% binds to the amino acids of the globin part of hemoglobin (not the heme), forming carbaminohemoglobin (HbCO2). Binding is influenced by PCO2 and degree of Hb oxygenation (Haldane Effect - deoxygenated Hb binds more CO2).
##### As Bicarbonate Ions (HCO3-) in Plasma #Level4 #~70% #MostImportantForm #CarbonicAnhydrase #ChlorideShift
Greatest amount (~70%) is transported as bicarbonate ions. CO2 diffuses into RBCs, combines with water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), catalyzed rapidly by carbonic anhydrase. H2CO3 dissociates into H+ and HCO3-. HCO3- then moves out of the RBC into plasma (transported) while Cl- moves in to maintain electrical balance (chloride shift). H+ binds to Hb (buffers pH). Process reverses in lungs.

##### Pontine Respiratory Centers #Level4 #Pons #SmoothTransitions #FineTuneRhythm
Located in the pons. Influence and modify activity of medullary neurons. Smooth out transitions between inspiration and expiration. Fine-tune breathing rhythms during activities like sleep, speech, exercise. (Pneumotaxic and Apneustic centers historically, now viewed as Pontine Respiratory Group - PRG).
#### Factors Influencing Breathing Rate and Depth #Level3 #ChemicalFactors #HigherBrainCenters #Reflexes
Breathing is modified in response to various stimuli.
##### Chemical Factors #Level4 #MostImportant #PCO2 #PO2 #pH #Chemoreceptors
Most important factors controlling respiration. Detected by central chemoreceptors (in medulla, sensitive to H+ in CSF derived from blood CO2) and peripheral chemoreceptors (in aortic arch and carotid arteries, sensitive to PCO2, H+, and large drops in PO2).
###### PCO2 #Level5 #MostPotentStimulus #Hypercapnia #Hypocapnia
Rising PCO2 levels (hypercapnia) are the most powerful respiratory stimulant. CO2 diffuses into CSF, forms H+, stimulating central chemoreceptors -> increased breathing rate/depth to flush CO2. Low PCO2 (hypocapnia) depresses respiration.
###### PO2 #Level5 #LessSensitiveStimulus #PeripheralChemoreceptors #RequiresLargeDrop
Oxygen levels primarily affect breathing indirectly via peripheral chemoreceptors. Significant stimulus only occurs when arterial PO2 drops substantially (below 60 mm Hg).
###### Arterial pH #Level5 #CanModifyIndependently #MetabolicAcidosis
Changes in arterial pH (due to metabolic causes like lactic acid accumulation or ketone bodies) can alter respiration via peripheral chemoreceptors, even if PCO2 and PO2 are normal. Acidosis increases respiration; alkalosis decreases it.
##### Influence of Higher Brain Centers #Level4 #CerebralCortex #Hypothalamus #LimbicSystem
Voluntary control (cerebral cortex) can override brainstem centers temporarily. Emotional states (hypothalamus, limbic system) can alter breathing patterns (e.g., gasping, holding breath).
##### Pulmonary Irritant Reflexes #Level4 #Cough #Sneeze #Bronchoconstriction
Receptors in airways respond to irritants (dust, fumes, mucus), triggering protective reflexes like coughing or sneezing, and bronchoconstriction.
##### Inflation Reflex (Hering-Breuer) #Level4 #StretchReceptors #Lungs #PreventsOverinflation
Stretch receptors in visceral pleurae and airways are stimulated by lung inflation. Send inhibitory signals to medullary centers, ending inhalation and allowing expiration. Thought to be mainly protective against overinflation, not active in normal quiet breathing.

Largest gland in the body, located in upper right quadrant under diaphragm. Numerous metabolic functions. Digestive role: produce Bile (~0.5-1 L/day) for fat emulsification. Also processes nutrient-rich blood from intestines (via hepatic portal vein), stores glycogen/vitamins, detoxifies blood, synthesizes plasma proteins. Composed of functional units called liver lobules.
###### Bile #Level5 #FatEmulsification #Alkaline #BileSalts #Bilirubin #Cholesterol
Yellow-green, alkaline solution containing bile salts, bile pigments (bilirubin - waste from heme), cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, electrolytes. Bile salts emulsify fats (break large globules into smaller ones), increasing surface area for lipase action. Stored and concentrated in gallbladder.
##### Gallbladder #Level4 #StoresConcentratesBile #MuscularSac #UnderLiver
Thin-walled muscular sac nestled in a fossa on the inferior surface of the liver. Stores bile not immediately needed for digestion and concentrates it by absorbing water/ions. Releases bile via cystic duct -> common bile duct into duodenum when stimulated (by CCK).
##### Pancreas #Level4 #MixedGland #ExocrineEndocrine #PancreaticJuice #Enzymes #Bicarbonate #Abdomen
Gland located mostly retroperitoneally, deep to stomach curvature. Has both endocrine (insulin, glucagon) and exocrine functions. Exocrine function: produce Pancreatic Juice (~1.2-1.5 L/day) containing digestive enzymes and bicarbonate. Acinar cells produce enzymes; duct cells produce bicarbonate-rich fluid. Juice drains via main pancreatic duct (joins bile duct) into duodenum.
###### Pancreatic Juice #Level5 #DigestiveEnzymes #Alkaline #NeutralizesChyme #Amylase #Lipases #Nucleases #Proteases
Alkaline solution (high HCO3-) neutralizes acidic chyme entering duodenum. Contains enzymes for digesting all food categories: Amylase (starch), Lipases (fats), Nucleases (nucleic acids), Proteases (proteins - released in inactive form like trypsinogen, activated in duodenum).

### Chemical Digestion and Absorption #Level2 #Macronutrients #BreakdownProducts #TransportMechanisms
Process of breaking down food molecules and absorbing the resulting nutrients. Occurs primarily in the small intestine.
#### Carbohydrates #Level3 #Starch #Sugars #Monosaccharides
Digestion begins in mouth (salivary amylase), resumes in small intestine (pancreatic amylase). Brush border enzymes (lactase, sucrase, maltase) break disaccharides into monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose). Absorption: Glucose/galactose via secondary active transport (co-transport with Na+); Fructose via facilitated diffusion. Enter capillary blood.
#### Proteins #Level3 #Polypeptides #AminoAcids
Digestion begins in stomach (pepsin). Continues in small intestine (pancreatic proteases like trypsin, chymotrypsin). Completed by brush border enzymes (aminopeptidases, dipeptidases). Absorption: Amino acids via active transport (often Na+-linked). Enter capillary blood.
#### Lipids (Fats) #Level3 #Triglycerides #FattyAcids #Monoglycerides
Digestion occurs primarily in small intestine. Requires emulsification by bile salts first. Pancreatic lipases break triglycerides into monoglycerides and fatty acids. Absorption: Monoglycerides/fatty acids associate with bile salts to form micelles, which ferry them to absorptive cell surface. Diffuse into enterocytes, re-esterified into triglycerides, packaged with proteins into chylomicrons. Chylomicrons enter lacteals (lymphatics), eventually reach blood.
#### Nucleic Acids #Level3 #DNA #RNA #Nucleotides #BasesSugarsPhosphates
Digested in small intestine by pancreatic nucleases (deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease) into nucleotides. Brush border enzymes (nucleosidases, phosphatases) break nucleotides down further. Absorption: Active transport across epithelium into blood.
#### Vitamins, Minerals, Water #Level3 #Absorption #SmallLargeIntestine
Vitamins: Fat-soluble (A, D, E, K) absorbed with lipids in micelles. Water-soluble (B vitamins, C) absorbed by diffusion or active/passive transport (B12 requires intrinsic factor). Minerals: Absorbed along small intestine via active transport, depending on body's need (e.g., iron, calcium regulated by hormones). Water: ~9 L enter GI tract daily; ~95% absorbed by osmosis, mostly in small intestine, remainder in large intestine.

## Urinary System (Renal System) #Level1 #Excretion #WasteRemoval #FluidBalance #ElectrolyteBalance #BloodPressureRegulation #Kidneys

Play role in final urine concentration, regulated by ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone), which controls water reabsorption by inserting aquaporins. Also involved in Na+ reabsorption (via aldosterone) and acid-base balance (H+/HCO3- secretion/reabsorption).
##### Types of Nephrons #Level4 #Cortical #Juxtamedullary
Based on location and loop length.
###### Cortical Nephrons #Level5 #~85% #MainlyInCortex #ShortLoop

###### Juxtamedullary Nephrons #Level5 #~15% #CorpuscleNearMedulla #LongLoop #ConcentratingUrine
Originate close to cortex-medulla junction. Long nephron loops extend deep into medulla. Associated with vasa recta capillaries. Crucial role in producing concentrated urine by maintaining medullary osmotic gradient.

### Urine Formation #Level2 #GlomerularFiltration #TubularReabsorption #TubularSecretion
Three major processes occurring in the nephrons to filter blood, process the filtrate, and form urine.
#### Glomerular Filtration #Level3 #PassiveProcess #PressureDriven #ProducesFiltrate
Passive process where hydrostatic pressure forces fluids and solutes (smaller than proteins) out of the glomerular blood into the glomerular capsule, forming filtrate. Driven by Net Filtration Pressure (NFP), which is the balance of outward pressures (glomerular hydrostatic pressure) and inward pressures (capsular hydrostatic pressure, colloid osmotic pressure of blood). Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is the volume of filtrate formed per minute (~125 ml/min). GFR is tightly regulated.
#### Tubular Reabsorption #Level3 #SelectiveProcess #FiltrateToBlood #ReclaimsUsefulSubstances #PCT_MainSite
Selective process reclaiming useful substances from the filtrate and returning them to the blood in peritubular capillaries or vasa recta. Occurs along the entire renal tubule, but mostly in PCT. Reclaims virtually all glucose, amino acids, vitamins; ~99% of water, Na+, K+, bicarbonate. Uses active and passive transport mechanisms. Water reabsorption driven by osmosis (follows solutes). Hormonally regulated in DCT/collecting duct (e.g., ADH for water, aldosterone for Na+, PTH for Ca2+).
#### Tubular Secretion #Level3 #SelectiveProcess #BloodToFiltrate #WasteRemoval #AcidBaseBalance #PCT_DCT_CD
Selective process moving substances (wastes, drugs, excess ions) from the blood in peritubular capillaries into the filtrate in the renal tubule. Occurs mainly in PCT, DCT, and collecting duct. Important for disposing of substances not already in filtrate (drugs, metabolites), eliminating undesirable substances reabsorbed passively (urea, uric acid), ridding body of excess K+ (via aldosterone), controlling blood pH (secreting H+ or HCO3-).

### Regulation of Urine Concentration and Volume #Level2 #Osmolality #CountercurrentMechanism #ADH
Mechanisms allowing kidneys to produce dilute or concentrated urine as needed to maintain body fluid homeostasis.
#### Countercurrent Mechanism #Level3 #MedullaryOsmoticGradient #LoopOfHenle #VasaRecta #ConcentratedUrine
Mechanism involving the interaction between filtrate flow in the opposing limbs of the juxtamedullary nephron loops (Countercurrent Multiplier) and blood flow in the opposing limbs of the associated vasa recta (Countercurrent Exchanger). Establishes and maintains an osmotic gradient extending from cortex into medulla, allowing kidneys to vary urine concentration.
##### Countercurrent Multiplier #Level4 #NephronLoop #EstablishesGradient
Descending limb permeable to water, impermeable to salt. Ascending limb impermeable to water, actively pumps out salt. Creates increasing osmolality gradient in medullary interstitium.
##### Countercurrent Exchanger #Level4 #VasaRecta #MaintainsGradient #PreventsSaltRemoval
Blood flow in vasa recta mirrors loop of Henle but in opposite direction. Picks up salt in descending part, loses salt in ascending part. Picks up water leaving descending loop. Prevents rapid removal of salt from medulla, preserving the gradient while supplying blood to medullary tissues.
#### Formation of Dilute vs. Concentrated Urine #Level3 #ADH_Influence #CollectingDuctPermeability
Depends on presence/absence of ADH.
##### Dilute Urine Formation #Level4 #Overhydration #ADH_Low #WaterNotReabsorbed
When well-hydrated, ADH release decreases. Collecting ducts remain impermeable to water. Filtrate remains dilute as it passes through, resulting in large volume of dilute urine.
##### Concentrated Urine Formation #Level4 #Dehydration #ADH_High #WaterReabsorbed
When dehydrated, posterior pituitary releases more ADH. ADH causes aquaporins to be inserted into collecting duct membranes, making them permeable to water. Water moves by osmosis from filtrate into hyperosmotic medullary interstitium and is reabsorbed into blood. Small volume of concentrated urine produced. Urea recycling contributes to medullary gradient.

### Physiology of Reproduction #Level2 #HormonalRegulation #OvarianCycle #UterineCycle #Pregnancy
Processes involving hormonal control, cyclical changes in females, fertilization, and pregnancy.
#### Hormonal Regulation (Male) #Level3 #HypothalamicPituitaryGonadalAxis #GnRH #LH #FSH #Testosterone #Inhibin
Hypothalamus releases Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) -> Anterior pituitary releases Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH). LH stimulates interstitial cells to produce testosterone. FSH stimulates Sertoli cells to release androgen-binding protein (ABP), which keeps testosterone levels high near spermatogenic cells, promoting spermatogenesis. Testosterone exerts negative feedback on hypothalamus/pituitary. Sertoli cells release inhibin when sperm count high (inhibits FSH release). Testosterone responsible for development/maintenance of primary/secondary sex characteristics, libido, spermatogenesis.
#### Hormonal Regulation and Cycles (Female) #Level3 #OvarianCycle #UterineCycle #HPG_Axis #Estrogen #Progesterone #Feedback
More complex cyclic pattern controlled by HPG axis. GnRH -> LH/FSH. FSH stimulates follicular growth/estrogen secretion. LH surge triggers ovulation and corpus luteum formation. Corpus luteum secretes progesterone and estrogen. Hormones drive Ovarian cycle (follicular development, ovulation, luteal phase) and Uterine (Menstrual) cycle (changes in endometrium). Estrogen/progesterone exert complex positive/negative feedback.
##### Ovarian Cycle #Level4 #MonthlyEvents #FollicularPhase #Ovulation #LutealPhase
Monthly series of events associated with maturation of an egg. Averages 28 days.
###### Follicular Phase (Days 1-14) #Level5 #FollicleGrowth #EstrogenDominant #FSH_Influence

###### Ovulation (Day ~14) #Level5 #OocyteRelease #LH_Surge
Vesicular follicle ruptures, releasing secondary oocyte. Triggered by LH surge (caused by high estrogen levels - positive feedback).
###### Luteal Phase (Days 14-28) #Level5 #CorpusLuteumActivity #ProgesteroneDominant #LH_Influence
Period of corpus luteum activity. Corpus luteum formed from ruptured follicle, secretes progesterone and estrogen. Progesterone prepares uterus for implantation. Duration constant (14 days). If no pregnancy, corpus luteum degenerates -> hormone levels fall -> menstruation. If pregnancy occurs, corpus luteum persists (maintained by hCG).
##### Uterine (Menstrual) Cycle #Level4 #MonthlyEndometrialChanges #ResponseToOvarianHormones #Menstrual #Proliferative #Secretory
Monthly series of changes in the uterine endometrium in response to fluctuating ovarian hormone levels. Coordinated with ovarian cycle.
###### Menstrual Phase (Days 1-5) #Level5 #SheddingOfFunctionalLayer #Bleeding

Events following successful intercourse leading to pregnancy.
##### Fertilization #Level4 #SpermMeetsEgg #ZygoteFormation #UterineTube
Sperm fuses with secondary oocyte (usually in uterine tube ampulla) to form a zygote (fertilized egg). Oocyte completes meiosis II. Requires capacitation of sperm.
##### Implantation #Level4 #BlastocystBurrows #Endometrium #~6_12DaysPostOvulation
Blastocyst (stage after zygote) adheres to and burrows into the endometrium. Typically begins about 6-7 days after ovulation, completed by day 12. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) secreted by developing embryo maintains corpus luteum.
##### Pregnancy #Level4 #Gestation #EmbryonicFetalDevelopment #~280Days #HormonalChanges #Placenta
Period from fertilization until birth (~40 weeks / 280 days from last menstrual period). Involves significant anatomical and physiological changes in mother, driven by hormones (hCG, estrogens, progesterone - initially from corpus luteum, later from placenta). Placenta develops (organ of exchange between mother and fetus). Embryonic period (first 8 weeks), Fetal period (week 9 to birth).
