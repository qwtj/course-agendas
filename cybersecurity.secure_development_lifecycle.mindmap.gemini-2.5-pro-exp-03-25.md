# Secure Development Lifecycle #SDL #SSDLC #AppSec
The Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) is a process for integrating security activities into the standard software development lifecycle (SDLC) to build more secure software. Its goal is to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities early in the development process, reducing risk and the cost of fixing issues. It involves embedding security requirements, tools, and practices into each phase.

## Introduction and Foundations #Overview #Principles #Goals
Understanding the core concepts, motivations, and benefits of adopting an SDL.
### Why SDL? #Motivation #ValueProposition
The increasing threat landscape and the high cost of fixing vulnerabilities later in the lifecycle or after release necessitate building security in from the start. Customers expect secure products.
### Benefits #Advantages #Impact
- Reduced number and severity of vulnerabilities.
- Lower development and remediation costs.
- Improved software reliability and trustworthiness.
- Enhanced compliance with security standards and regulations.
- Fosters a security-aware culture.
### Core Principles #Fundamentals #Concepts
- Security is everyone's responsibility (developers, testers, operations, PMs).
- Build security in, don't bolt it on.
- Address security early and continuously throughout the lifecycle.
- Adopt a risk-based approach.
- Continuous improvement and learning.
### People, Process, Technology #Triangle #Framework
SDL involves coordinating people (training, culture), defining processes (phases, activities), and leveraging technology (security tools).

## Training #Education #Awareness #Skills
Ensuring all personnel involved in development have the necessary security knowledge and skills. This is often considered a foundational or supporting activity conducted before other phases begin.
### Role-Based Training #Targeted #Specific
Different roles (developers, testers, architects, PMs) require specific security training relevant to their responsibilities. Training should cover secure development techniques, common vulnerabilities, and threat awareness.
### Content #Curriculum #Topics
- Security basics and awareness.
- Secure coding practices and standards.
- Threat modeling concepts.
- Security tools usage.
- Secure design principles.
- Incident response procedures.
- Privacy considerations.
### Frequency #Cadence #Refreshers
Initial training for new hires and annual refreshers are common practices. Continuous learning opportunities should be provided.

### Code Reviews #PeerReview #ManualInspection
Performing manual reviews of code by peers or security experts to identify flaws missed by automated tools, including logic errors. Enforcing separation of duties in reviews.
### Secrets Management #Credentials #Keys
Avoiding hardcoding secrets (passwords, API keys) in source code; using secure storage solutions. Employing credential/secret scanners.

## Verification Phase #Testing #Validation #QualityAssurance
