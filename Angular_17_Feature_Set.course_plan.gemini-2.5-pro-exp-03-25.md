    import { signal } from '@angular/core';

    const count = signal(0); // Create signal with initial value 0
    console.log(count());    // Read value: 0
    count.set(5);            // Set value to 5
    count.update(value => value + 1); // Update based on current value (now 6)
    ```

### 2. Defining `computed`
"<prompt>Explain how to create a computed signal using the `computed()` function in Angular 17. Describe how it derives its value reactively from other signals and automatically updates when its dependencies change. Emphasize that computed signals are read-only."
*   **Example:**
    ```typescript
    import { signal, computed } from '@angular/core';

    const firstName = signal('Jane');
    const lastName = signal('Doe');
    const fullName = computed(() => `${firstName()} ${lastName()}`); // Derived signal
    console.log(fullName()); // Read value: "Jane Doe"
    firstName.set('John');
    console.log(fullName()); // Automatically updated: "John Doe"
    ```

### 3. Using `effect`
"<prompt>Explain how to create a reactive effect using the `effect()` function in Angular 17. Describe its purpose for running side effects (like logging, data fetching, DOM updates) in response to changes in dependent signals. Mention the injection context requirement or using `Injector.runInContext()`."
*   **Example:**
    ```typescript
    import { signal, effect, Injector } from '@angular/core';

    const userId = signal(1);
    // Typically run inside a constructor or factory where Injector is available
    constructor(private injector: Injector) {
      effect(() => {
        console.log(`User ID changed to: ${userId()}`);
        // Perform side effect, e.g., fetch user data
        // Be cautious of infinite loops if the effect updates its own dependencies
      });
    }
    // Or outside injection context:
    // this.injector.runInContext(() => {
    //   effect(() => console.log(userId()));
    // });
    ```

### 4. Integrating Signals with Components

    import { Component } from '@angular/core';
    import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common'; // Import if using *ngIf, *ngFor etc. (or use new control flow)
    import { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button';
    import { MyStandalonePipe } from '../pipes/my-standalone.pipe';

    @Component({
      selector: 'app-standalone-example',
      standalone: true,
      imports: [
          CommonModule, // Still needed for some pipes like 'async', 'date', etc. if not using standalone alternatives
          MatButtonModule,
          MyStandalonePipe
          // No need to import @if, @for, @switch - they are built-in

### 1. Understanding `afterRender`
"<prompt>Describe the `afterRender` lifecycle hook in Angular 17. Explain that its callback runs after *every* change detection cycle that causes rendering updates. Discuss its use cases, such as integrating third-party DOM-based libraries, and caution against writing to the DOM within it to avoid layout thrashing."
*   **Example:**
    ```typescript
    import { Component, afterRender, ElementRef, inject } from '@angular/core';

    @Component({...})
    export class MyComponent {
      elementRef = inject(ElementRef);

      constructor() {
        afterRender(() => {
          // Runs after *every* render. Use cautiously.
          // Good for read operations or non-Angular library initialization.
          console.log('Render finished for MyComponent. DOM element:', this.elementRef.nativeElement);
        });
      }
    }
    ```

### 2. Understanding `afterNextRender`

    import { Component, afterNextRender, viewChild, ElementRef } from '@angular/core';

    @Component({...})
    export class AnotherComponent {
      chartContainer = viewChild<ElementRef>('chart');

      initializeChart() {
        // Assume this updates some state that triggers rendering
        afterNextRender(() => {
          // Runs once after the next render completes.
          // Ideal for initializing a chart library on its container element.
          if (this.chartContainer()) {
             // new Chart(this.chartContainer()?.nativeElement, ...);
             console.log('Chart initialized after next render.');
          }
        });
      }
    }
    ```

### 3. Comparison with `AfterViewInit` / `AfterContentInit`
"<prompt>Briefly compare and contrast the new `afterRender` / `afterNextRender` hooks with the traditional `AfterViewInit` / `AfterContentInit` lifecycle hooks in Angular 17. Highlight differences in timing (relative to rendering completion vs. view/content initialization) and execution context (browser-only for new hooks)."

## C. Input Signal Transformation (`transform` function)
"<prompt>Explain the `transform` option available for the `input()` function (part of the Signals API, often used with components) in Angular 17. Describe how it allows transforming input values as they are set, such as converting strings to numbers or booleans."
*   **Example:**

    import { Component, input, InputFunction } from '@angular/core';
    import { booleanAttribute } from '@angular/core'; // Helper function

    @Component({
        selector: 'app-icon',
        standalone: true,
        template: `<span [class.disabled]="isDisabled()">Icon</span>`
    })
    export class IconComponent {
        // Transforms attribute presence to boolean
        isDisabled: InputFunction<boolean> = input(false, { transform: booleanAttribute });
        // Transforms string input to number
        size: InputFunction<number> = input(0, { transform: (value: string | number) => typeof value === 'string' ? parseInt(value, 10) : value });
    }

    // Usage: <app-icon disabled size="24"></app-icon>
    ```
*   **Key Term:** `input.required` - "<prompt>Also mention the related `input.required<T>()` function in Angular 17 for defining mandatory component inputs using the Signals API."

*   **Summary:** Angular 17 improves the developer experience by making Standalone APIs the default, simplifying component structure and dependency management.

*   **Quiz:** "<prompt>Generate 3 true/false quiz questions testing understanding of: 1) Whether NgModules are required by default in Angular 17. 2) Whether `afterRender` runs only once. 3) Whether input transforms can convert data types."
*   **Transition:** Having covered core changes, build systems, and developer experience, we will now delve into advanced techniques for leveraging these new features, focusing on optimization and complex integrations.
*   **Callout:** > **Simplicity:** `standalone: true` by default significantly reduces boilerplate and the cognitive load associated with NgModules, especially for smaller applications or libraries.
*   **Reflective Prompt:** "<prompt>Ask the learner to reflect: How will the default standalone components and the new lifecycle hooks influence your component design patterns in future Angular 17 projects?"
*   **Cross-reference:** The `afterRender` / `afterNextRender` hooks (III.B) are particularly useful when working with Signals (I.C) that trigger DOM updates, providing a reliable point for interaction. Input transforms (III.C) complement the use of Signals for component inputs.

"<prompt>Explain strategies for robust error handling within `@defer` blocks in Angular 17. Discuss capturing errors from the deferred component's loading process using the `@error` block and potentially logging errors or displaying user-friendly messages."

### 2. Debugging Complex Scenarios
"<prompt>Provide techniques for debugging complex scenarios involving interactions between Signals, new control flow, `@defer` blocks, and asynchronous operations in Angular 17."
*   **Troubleshooting `@for` `track` Issues:** "<prompt>Describe common problems (e.g., duplicate keys, non-unique tracking identifiers) and debugging strategies related to the `track` function in Angular 17's `@for` block using browser console errors and component state inspection."
*   **Debugging `@defer` Loading Conditions:** "<prompt>Explain how to debug issues where a `@defer` block in Angular 17 isn't loading as expected. Cover checking trigger conditions (`on`, `when`), ensuring necessary modules are loadable, inspecting network requests, and examining console errors."
*   **Debugging Signal Computations (`computed`, `effect`):** "<prompt>Describe approaches for debugging unexpected behavior in `computed` signals or `effect` functions in Angular 17. Suggest using logging within these functions (carefully), checking dependencies, and using Angular DevTools to inspect signal values."

### 3. Leveraging Angular DevTools
"<prompt>Show how Angular DevTools can be used to inspect component hierarchy, state (including Signals), and dependencies, aiding in the debugging of applications built with Angular 17's latest features. Highlight specific DevTools features relevant to Signals and the new template syntax if available."

## B. Understanding Potential Breaking Changes & Deprecations
"<prompt>Emphasize the importance of staying informed about changes introduced in new Angular versions, particularly potential breaking changes or deprecations related to the features learned."

### 1. Reviewing Official Migration Guides
"<prompt>Stress the necessity of consulting the official Angular Update Guide (update.angular.io) and release notes when migrating projects to Angular 17 or future versions. Point out that these resources detail breaking changes, deprecations, and automated migration schematics." *(Provide Link: https://update.angular.io/)*

### 2. Monitoring Deprecation Warnings
"<prompt>Advise developers to pay attention to deprecation warnings issued in the browser console or build output during development with Angular 17, as these often indicate APIs or features that will be removed in future versions, allowing time for proactive refactoring."

*   **Summary:** Effective debugging in Angular 17 involves understanding common pitfalls with new features like `@for track` and `@defer` triggers, leveraging Angular DevTools for state inspection, implementing error handling (e.g., in `@defer`), and staying current via official documentation and deprecation warnings.
