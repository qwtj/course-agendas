## Command-Line Interface (CLI) Usage #CLI #Syntax #Commands
Understanding and using the `ffmpeg` command-line tool. [21, 17, 24]
### Basic Syntax Structure #Format #Structure
`ffmpeg [global_options] {[input_options] -i input_url} ... {[output_options] output_url} ...` [5, 21, 24]
Options generally apply to the *next* file specified (input or output). Global options should come first. [21]
### Input/Output Specification #Files #Streams #URLs
Using `-i` for inputs and specifying output URLs directly. Handling multiple inputs/outputs. [21, 17]
### Stream Selection (`-map`) #Mapping #Streams #Selection
Explicitly controlling which streams from input files are processed and included in output files. [21, 17]
Example: `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream from the first input. `-map 0:a:1` selects the second audio stream from the first input.
### Codec Selection (`-c`, `-codec`) #Codecs #Encoding #Decoding
Specifying encoders/decoders for audio (`-c:a`), video (`-c:v`), and subtitles (`-c:s`). [21, 1]
Using `copy` (e.g., `-c copy`, `-c:v copy`) for stream copying (remuxing) without re-encoding. [1, 3, 21]
### Format Specification (`-f`) #Formats #Containers
Forcing input (`-f input_format`) or output (`-f output_format`) container formats. [21]
### Filtering (`-vf`, `-af`, `-filter_complex`) #Filters #Processing #Effects
Applying audio (`-af`) and video (`-vf`) filters. Using `-filter_complex` for complex filtergraphs involving multiple inputs/outputs. [1, 17, 21]
### Setting Options (Bitrate, Frame Rate, Resolution) #Parameters #Quality #Control
Controlling output parameters like video bitrate (`-b:v`), audio bitrate (`-b:a`), frame rate (`-r`), resolution (`-s WxH`). [21, 1]
### Seeking and Duration (`-ss`, `-t`, `-to`) #Trimming #Cutting #Timing
Specifying start time (`-ss`) and duration (`-t` or end time `-to`) for inputs or outputs. [1, 3]
Note: Placement of `-ss` (before or after `-i`) affects precision and speed.
### Metadata Handling (`-metadata`) #Tags #Information
Adding, removing, or modifying metadata tags in output files. [2]
### Hardware Acceleration #HWAccel #GPU #Performance
Utilizing hardware capabilities (GPU) for decoding/encoding (e.g., NVENC, QSV, VAAPI, VideoToolbox). [10, 9]
Requires specific compile-time flags and runtime options.
### Getting Help & Information #Help #Info #Diagnostics
Using flags like `-h`, `-formats`, `-codecs`, `-filters`, `-protocols` to query FFmpeg's capabilities. [23]

### Extracting Audio/Video Streams #Extraction #Separation
Saving only the audio or video from a file. [1, 3, 8]

FFmpeg utilizes multi-threading in many components (decoding, encoding, filtering). [9, 11, 19]
Can be controlled with the `-threads` option (though often best left default). [9]
Recent versions have parallelized pipeline components (demuxing, decoding, filtering, encoding, muxing run in parallel). [11, 19]
### Preset Files (`-preset`, `-tune`) #Presets #Optimization #Quality
Using predefined settings (`-preset`) to balance encoding speed vs. compression efficiency (e.g., `ultrafast`, `veryfast`, `medium`, `slow`, `veryslow`). [9, 2]
Using tuning options (`-tune`) to optimize for specific content types (e.g., `film`, `animation`, `zerolatency`). [21]
### Two-Pass Encoding #BitrateControl #Quality #Optimization
Encoding a file twice to achieve better bitrate distribution and quality, especially for Variable Bitrate (VBR) encoding. [9]
Involves a first pass to gather statistics and a second pass to perform the actual encoding using those stats.
