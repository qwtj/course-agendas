Learning Objectives: Understand foundational thermodynamics concepts, apply the first and second laws, analyze thermodynamic cycles, and explore mixtures, chemical reactions, and statistical thermodynamics.

Prerequisites: Basic physics and calculus knowledge.

Depth & Scope: Overview to intermediate level, focusing on fundamental principles and applications, excluding rigorous mathematical derivations in statistical thermodynamics.

Target Audience: Engineering students or professionals seeking a refresher on thermodynamics.

Technical Details: Ideal gas law (`PV = nRT`), specific heat capacity (`Q = mcΔT`), first law (`ΔU = Q - W`), enthalpy (`H = U + PV`), entropy change (`ΔS = ∫dQ/T`), Carnot efficiency (`η_carnot = 1 - (TC/TH)`), Rankine cycle analysis, psychrometric chart usage.

Relevant Technologies/Tools: Python (with libraries like CoolProp for property calculations), MATLAB (for cycle simulation), Engineering Equation Solver (EES).

Preferred Format/Length: Detailed explanations with concise examples of each concept and cycle.
