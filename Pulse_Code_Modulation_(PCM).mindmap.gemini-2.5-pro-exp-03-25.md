# Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) #DigitalModulation #Overview
Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) is a fundamental digital modulation technique used to represent analog signals in a digital format. It involves sampling the analog signal's amplitude at regular intervals, quantizing these samples to discrete levels, and then encoding these levels into binary code.

## Foundational Concepts #Basics #Theory
Underlying principles required to understand PCM and its context in signal processing.

### Analog vs. Digital Signals #SignalTypes #Comparison
Definition and characteristics of continuous-time analog signals versus discrete-time, discrete-amplitude digital signals.

### Signal Sampling #Process #CoreConcept
Converting a continuous-time signal into a discrete-time signal by taking measurements (samples) at regular intervals.

#### Sampling Theorem (Nyquist-Shannon) #Theorem #Criteria
States that a bandlimited analog signal can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples if the sampling rate (fs) is greater than twice the maximum frequency (fm) of the signal (fs > 2fm).
This minimum sampling rate (2fm) is known as the Nyquist rate.

#### Aliasing #Distortion #SamplingError
Distortion introduced when the sampling rate is below the Nyquist rate, causing higher frequencies to impersonate lower frequencies in the sampled signal.
Prevented using an anti-aliasing filter (low-pass filter) before sampling.

### Quantization #Process #Approximation
Mapping the continuous amplitude values of samples to a finite set of discrete amplitude levels.

### Encoding #Process #Representation
Assigning a unique binary codeword to each discrete quantization level.

## The PCM Encoding Process (Transmitter) #Workflow #Digitization
Steps involved in converting an analog signal into a PCM digital stream at the transmitter end.

### Pre-filtering (Anti-aliasing) #Filtering #Preparation
Using a low-pass filter to remove frequency components above half the intended sampling rate to prevent aliasing.

### Sampling #TimeDiscretization #Measurement
Taking instantaneous amplitude values of the filtered analog signal at regular, discrete time intervals (Ts = 1/fs).

#### Sample-and-Hold Circuit #Circuitry #Implementation
A circuit that captures (samples) the signal voltage and holds it constant for a short duration, allowing the quantizer/ADC enough time to operate.

### Quantization #AmplitudeDiscretization #Mapping
Assigning each sample's amplitude to the nearest level from a predefined set of discrete quantization levels (L).

#### Quantization Levels (L) #Parameter #Resolution
The number of discrete amplitude values used to represent the signal range. Often a power of 2 (L = 2^n, where n is the number of bits).

#### Quantization Step Size (Δ or Q) #Parameter #Interval
The voltage difference between two adjacent quantization levels. Δ = (Vmax - Vmin) / L.

#### Quantization Error (Noise) #Error #Distortion
The difference between the actual sample amplitude and the chosen quantization level. It's an inherent source of noise/distortion in PCM.
Max error is typically ±Δ/2 for uniform quantization.

### Encoding #BinaryConversion #Coding
Converting each quantized sample level into a binary codeword of 'n' bits, where L = 2^n.

#### Binary Code Assignment #Code #Format
Assigning unique binary numbers (e.g., natural binary, Gray code) to each quantization level.

## PCM Decoding Process (Receiver) #Workflow #Reconstruction
Steps involved in converting the received PCM digital stream back into an approximation of the original analog signal.

### Regeneration #SignalRestoration #NoiseImmunity
Reshaping and retiming the received digital pulses to combat noise and distortion introduced during transmission. Repeaters perform this along the transmission path.

### Decoding #BinaryConversion #LevelMapping
Converting the incoming binary codewords back into their corresponding quantized amplitude levels.

### Reconstruction (Digital-to-Analog Conversion - DAC) #SignalConversion #AnalogOutput
Generating an analog voltage or current proportional to the decoded quantization level for each sample interval. Often involves holding the level constant for the sample duration (Zero-Order Hold).

### Post-filtering (Reconstruction Filter) #Filtering #Smoothing
Using a low-pass filter (similar cutoff to the anti-aliasing filter, fm) to smooth out the staircase-like output from the DAC, removing high-frequency components introduced by the discrete steps and approximating the original analog waveform.

## Key Parameters and Performance Metrics #Characteristics #Evaluation
Quantifiable aspects that define a PCM system's operation and quality.

### Sampling Rate (fs) #Parameter #Frequency
The number of samples taken per second (Hz or samples/sec). Determines the maximum frequency representable (fs/2). #Nyquist

### Bit Depth (n) #Parameter #Resolution
The number of bits used to encode each sample (bits/sample). Determines the number of quantization levels (L=2^n) and thus the amplitude resolution. #Quantization

### Number of Quantization Levels (L) #Parameter #AmplitudeSteps
The total count of discrete levels used for quantization (L = 2^n). #Resolution

### Bit Rate (Rb) #Metric #DataRate
The total number of bits transmitted per second (bps or bits/sec). Rb = n * fs. #Bandwidth

### Bandwidth Requirements #Metric #Transmission
The range of frequencies required to transmit the PCM signal. Theoretically infinite, but practically limited. Minimum required bandwidth often estimated as Rb/2 (Nyquist bandwidth). Line coding affects actual bandwidth.

### Signal-to-Quantization Noise Ratio (SQNR or SNRq) #Metric #Quality
A measure of the quality of the PCM signal, representing the ratio of the signal power to the quantization noise power. Often expressed in decibels (dB).
For uniform quantization, SQNR (dB) ≈ 6.02n + 1.76. Each additional bit increases SQNR by approximately 6 dB.

### Dynamic Range #Metric #AmplitudeRange
The ratio of the maximum representable signal amplitude to the minimum representable signal amplitude (excluding zero). Related to the bit depth.

## Types of PCM #Variations #Techniques
Different approaches to implementing the quantization step in PCM.

### Linear PCM (LPCM) #Standard #Uniform
Uses uniform quantization steps across the entire signal amplitude range. Simpler to implement but less efficient for signals with non-uniform amplitude distributions (like speech). #Audio #CD

### Non-Linear PCM #Companding #NonUniform
Uses non-uniform quantization steps – smaller steps for low-amplitude signals and larger steps for high-amplitude signals. Improves SQNR for low-level signals without increasing the bit rate significantly. Common in telephony.

#### Companding #Technique #CompressionExpansion
The process of compressing the signal's dynamic range at the transmitter before uniform quantization and expanding it at the receiver after decoding. #Logarithmic

#### μ-Law Companding #Standard #Telephony
A specific logarithmic companding standard used primarily in North America and Japan. Defined by ITU-T G.711.

#### A-Law Companding #Standard #Telephony
A different logarithmic companding standard used primarily in Europe and the rest of the world. Also defined by ITU-T G.711.

### Regenerative Repeaters #SignalBoost #Restoration
Devices placed along the transmission path that detect the degraded digital signal, regenerate it (reshape, retime), and retransmit it, preventing noise accumulation common in analog systems.

### Synchronization #Timing #Framing
Ensuring the receiver clock is aligned with the transmitter clock (bit synchronization) and identifying the start and end of codewords or frames (frame synchronization). Framing bits or specific line codes aid synchronization.
